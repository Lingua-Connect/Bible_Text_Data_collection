Verse Text
In the past there were false prophets among God’s people. It is the same now. You will have some false teachers in your group. They will teach things that are wrong—ideas that will cause people to be lost. And they will teach in a way that will be hard for you to see that they are wrong. They will even refuse to follow the Master who bought their freedom. And so they will quickly destroy themselves.
"Many people will follow them in the morally wrong things they do. And because of them, others will say bad things about the way of truth we follow."

"But he saved Lot, a good man who lived there. Lot was greatly troubled by the morally bad lives of those evil people."
"This good man lived with those evil people every day, and his good heart was hurt by the evil things he saw and heard."
So you see that the Lord God knows how to save those who are devoted to him. He will save them when troubles come. And the Lord will hold evil people to punish them on the day of judgment.
That punishment is for those who are always doing the evil that their sinful selves want to do. It is for those who hate the Lord’s authority.
The angels are much stronger and more powerful than these beings. But even the angels don’t accuse them and say bad things about them to the Lord.
"But these false teachers speak evil against what they don’t understand. They are like animals that do things without really thinking—like wild animals that are born to be caught and killed. And, like wild animals, they will be destroyed."

"But a donkey told him that he was doing wrong. A donkey cannot talk, of course, but that donkey spoke with a man’s voice and stopped the prophet from acting so crazy."
These false teachers are like springs that have no water. They are like clouds that are blown by a storm. A place in the deepest darkness has been kept for them.
They boast with words that mean nothing. They lead people into the trap of sin. They find people who have just escaped from a wrong way of life and lead them back into sin. They do this by using the evil things people want to do in their human weakness.
"These false teachers promise those people freedom, but they themselves are not free. They are slaves to a mind that has been ruined by sin. Yes, people are slaves to anything that controls them."
