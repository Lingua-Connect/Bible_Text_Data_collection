Verse Text
"Here is the point of what we are saying: We have a high priest like that, who sits on the right sideof God’s throne in heaven."
"Our high priest serves in the Most Holy Place.He serves in the true place of worshipthat was made by God, not by anyone here on earth."
Every high priest has the work of offering gifts and sacrifices to God. So our high priest must also offer something to God.
"If our high priest were now living on earth, he would not be a priest. I say this because there are already priests here who follow the law by offering gifts to God."
The work that these priests do is really only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven. That is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the Holy Tent: “Be sure to make everything exactly like the pattern I showed you on the mountain.”
"But the work that has been given to Jesus is much greater than the work that was given to those priests. In the same way, the new agreement that Jesus brought from God to his people is much greater than the old one. And the new agreement is based on better promises."
"If there was nothing wrong with the first agreement, then there would be no need for a second agreement."
"But God found something wrong with the people. He said,"
It will not be like the agreement
This is the new agreement I will give the people of Israel.
Never again will anyone have to teach their neighbors
"And I will forgive the wrongs they have done,"
"God called this a new agreement, so he has made the first agreement old. And anything that is old and useless is ready to disappear."
