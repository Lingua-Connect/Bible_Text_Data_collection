"When we heard this, we and the other followers there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem."
"But he said, “Why are you crying and making me feel so sad? I am willing to be put in jail in Jerusalem. I am even ready to die for the name of the Lord Jesus!”"

"When the leaders heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul, “Brother, you can see that thousands of Jews have become believers, but they think it is very important to obey the Law of Moses."
They have been told that you teach the Jews who live in non-Jewish regions to stop following the Law of Moses. They have heard that you tell them not to circumcise their sons or follow our other customs.
“What should we do? The Jewish believers here will learn that you have come.
So we will tell you what to do: Four of our men have made a vowto God.
Take these men with you and share in their cleansing ceremony.Pay their expenses so that they can shave their heads.This will prove to everyone that the things they have heard about you are not true. They will see that you obey the Law of Moses in your own life.
"“In regard to the non-Jewish believers, we have already sent a letter to them saying what we think they should do:"

This is what he teaches people everywhere. And now he has brought some Greeks into the Temple area and has made this holy place unclean!”"
(The Jews said this because they had seen Trophimus with Paul in Jerusalem. Trophimus was a man from Ephesus. The Jews thought that Paul had taken him into the holy area of the Temple.)

"The commander went over to Paul and arrested him. He told his soldiers to tie him up with two chains. Then he asked, “Who is this man? What has he done wrong?”"
"Some people there were shouting one thing, and others were shouting something else. Because of all this confusion and shouting, the commander could not learn the truth about what had happened. So he told the soldiers to take Paul to the army building."
"The whole crowd was following them. When the soldiers came to the steps, they had to carry Paul. They did this to protect him, because the people were ready to hurt him. The people were shouting, “Kill him!”"
"When the soldiers were ready to take Paul into the army building, he asked the commander, “Can I say something to you?”"
Then you are not the man I thought you were. I thought you were the Egyptian who started some trouble against the government not long ago and led four thousand terrorists out to the desert.”
