Verse Text
Remember this: There are some terrible times coming in the last days.
People will love only themselves and money. They will be proud and boast about themselves. They will abuse others with insults. They will not obey their parents. They will be ungrateful and against all that is pleasing to God.
They will have no love for others and will refuse to forgive anyone. They will talk about others to hurt them and will have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good.
"People will turn against their friends. They will do foolish things without thinking and will be so proud of themselves. Instead of loving God, they will love pleasure."
"They will go on pretending to be devoted to God, but they will refuse to let that “devotion” change the way they live. Stay away from these people!"
"Some of them go into homes and get control over weak women, whose lives are full of sin—women who are led into sin by all the things they want."
"These women always want to learn something new, but they are never able to fully understand the truth."
"Just as Jannes and Jambresfought against Moses, these people fight against the truth. Their thinking has been confused. The faith they have and teach is worthless."
But they will not succeed in what they are trying to do. Everyone will see how foolish they are. That is what happened to Jannes and Jambres.
"But you know all about me. You know what I teach and the way I live. You know my goal in life. You know my faith, my patience, and my love. You know that I never stop trying."
"You know about my persecutions and my sufferings. You know all the things that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra—the persecution I suffered in those places. But the Lord saved me from all of it."
Everyone who wants to live showing true devotion to God in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
"People who are evil and cheat others will become worse and worse. They will fool others, but they will also be fooling themselves."
"But you should continue following the teaching you learned. You know it is true, because you know you can trust those who taught you."
You have known the Holy Scripturessince you were a child. These Scriptures are able to make you wise. And that wisdom leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is given by God. And all Scripture is useful for teaching and for showing people what is wrong in their lives. It is useful for correcting faults and teaching the right way to live.
"Using the Scriptures, those who serve God will be prepared and will have everything they need to do every good work."
