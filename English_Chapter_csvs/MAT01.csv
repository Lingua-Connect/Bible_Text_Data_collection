Verse Text
"This is the family history of Jesus the Messiah. He came from the family of David, who was from the family of Abraham."
Abraham was the father of Isaac.
Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah. (Their mother was Tamar.)
Ram was the father of Amminadab.
Salmon was the father of Boaz. (His mother was Rahab.)
Jesse was the father of King David.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh.
"Josiah was the grandfather of Jehoiachinand his brothers, who lived during the time that the people were taken away to Babylon."
After they were taken to Babylon:
Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud.
Azor was the father of Zadok.
Eliud was the father of Eleazar.
Jacob was the father of Joseph.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were also fourteen generations from David until the people were taken away to Babylon. And there were fourteen more from the time the people were taken to Babylon until the Messiah was born.
"This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah happened. His mother Mary was engaged to marry Joseph. But before they married, he learned that she was expecting a baby. (She was pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.)"
"Mary’s husband, Joseph, was a good man. He did not want to cause her public disgrace, so he planned to divorce her secretly."
"But after Joseph thought about this, an angel from the Lord came to him in a dream. The angel said, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to accept Mary to be your wife. The baby inside her is from the Holy Spirit."
She will give birth to a son. You will name him Jesus.Give him that name because he will save his people from their sins.”
All this happened to make clear the full meaning of what the Lord said through the prophet:
“The virgin will be pregnant and will give birth to a son. They will name him Immanuel.”(Immanuel means “God with us.”)
"When Joseph woke up, he did what the Lord’s angel told him to do. He married Mary."
But Joseph did not have sexual relations with her until her son was born. And he named him Jesus.
