"Then Jesus said, “The lightwill be with you for only a short time more. So walk while you have the light. Then the darkness will not catch you. People who walk in the darkness don’t know where they are going."

That is because what I taught was not from myself. The Father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach.
And I know that whatever he says to do will bring eternal life. So the things I say are exactly what the Father told me to say.”
