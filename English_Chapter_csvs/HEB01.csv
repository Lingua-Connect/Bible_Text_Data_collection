Verse Text
In the past God spoke to our people through the prophets. He spoke to them many times and in many different ways.
"And now in these last days, God has spoken to us again through his Son. He made the whole world through his Son. And he has chosen his Son to have all things."
"The Son shows the glory of God. He is a perfect copy of Godâ€™s nature, and he holds everything together by his powerful command. The Son made people clean from their sins. Then he sat down at the right sideof God, the Great One in heaven."
"The Son became much greater than the angels, and God gave him a name that is much greater than any of their names."
God never said this to any of the angels:
"And then, when God presents his firstborn Son to the world,he says,"
This is what God said about the angels:
But this is what he said about his Son:
You love what is right and hate what is wrong.
"God also said,"
"These things will disappear, but you will stay."
"You will fold them up like a coat,"
And God never said this to an angel:
All the angels are spirits who serve God and are sent to help those who will receive salvation.
