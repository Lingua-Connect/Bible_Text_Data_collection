<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 20</div><div class='s'>Jewish Leaders Doubt Jesus’ Authority </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 21:23-27; Mark 11:27-33) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>One day Jesus was in the Temple area teaching the people. He was telling them the Good News. The leading priests, teachers of the law, and older Jewish leaders came to talk to Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They said, “Tell us what authority you have to do these things. Who gave you this authority?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “I will ask you a question too. Tell me:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When John baptized people, did his authority come from God or was it only from other people?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The priests, the teachers of the law, and the Jewish leaders all talked about this. They said to each other, “If we answer, ‘John’s baptism was from God,’ then he will say, ‘Then why did you not believe John?’  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But if we say that John’s baptism was from someone else, the people will stone us to death. They all believe that John was a prophet.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So they answered, “We don’t know the answer.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Jesus said to them, “Then I will not tell you who gave me the authority to do these things.” </div><div class='s'>God Sends His Son </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 21:33-46; Mark 12:1-12) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Jesus told the people this story: “A man planted a vineyard. He leased the land to some farmers. Then he went away for a long time.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Later, it was time for the grapes to be picked. So the man sent a servant to those farmers so that they would give him his share of the grapes. But they beat the servant and sent him away with nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So the man sent another servant. They beat this servant too and showed no respect for him. They sent the servant away with nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So the man sent a third servant to the farmers. They hurt this servant badly and threw him out. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“The owner of the vineyard said, ‘What will I do now? I will send my son. I love my son very much. Maybe the farmers will respect my son.’  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When the farmers saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the owner’s son. This vineyard will be his. If we kill him, it will be ours.’  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him. </div><div class='p'>“What will the owner of the vineyard do?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He will come and kill those farmers. Then he will lease the land to some other farmers.” </div><div class='p'>When the people heard this story, they said, “This should never happen!”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But Jesus looked into their eyes and said, “Then what does this verse mean: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘The stone that the builders refused to accept </div><div class='q2'>became the cornerstone’? <span class='rq'><a href='PSA118.htm#V22'>Psalm 118:22</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken. If that stone falls on you, it will crush you!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>When the teachers of the law and the leading priests heard this story, they knew it was about them. So they wanted to arrest Jesus right then, but they were afraid of what the people would do. </div><div class='s'>The Jewish Leaders Try to Trick Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 22:15-22; Mark 12:13-17) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So the Jewish leaders waited for the right time to get Jesus. They sent some men to him, who pretended to be sincere. They wanted to find something wrong with what Jesus said. (If they found something wrong, then they could hand him over to the governor, who had the authority to arrest him.)  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So the men said to Jesus, “Teacher, we know that what you say and teach is true. It doesn’t matter who is listening—you teach the same to all people. You always teach the truth about God’s way.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Tell us, is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But Jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him. He said to them,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>“Show me a silver coin. Whose name and picture are on it?” </div><div class='p'>They said, “Caesar’s.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He said to them, “Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The men were amazed at his wise answer. They could say nothing. They were not able to trick Jesus there in front of the people. He said nothing they could use against him. </div><div class='s'>Some Sadducees Try to Trick Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 22:23-33; Mark 12:18-27) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Some Sadducees came to Jesus. (Sadducees believe that people will not rise from death.) They asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“Teacher, Moses wrote that if a married man dies and had no children, his brother must marry his widow. Then they will have children for the dead brother.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> if … dead brother See Deuteronomy 25:5, 6.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>One time there were seven brothers. The first brother married a woman but died. He had no children.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then the second brother married the woman, and he died.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the third brother married the woman, and he died. The same thing happened with all the other brothers. They all died and had no children.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The woman was the last to die.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But all seven brothers married her. So when people rise from death, whose wife will this woman be?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus said to the Sadducees, “On earth, people marry each other.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Some people will be worthy to be raised from death and live again after this life. In that life they will not marry.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>In that life people are like angels and cannot die. They are children of God, because they have been raised from death.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Moses clearly showed that people are raised from death. When Moses wrote about the burning bush,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> burning bush See Exodus 3:1-12.</span></a> he said that the Lord is ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> ‘the God of … Jacob’ Words taken from Exodus 3:6.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>So they were not still dead, because he is the God only of living people. Yes, to God they are all still living.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Some of the teachers of the law said, “Teacher, your answer was very good.”  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>No one was brave enough to ask him another question. </div><div class='s'>Is the Messiah David’s Son <br/> or David’s Lord? </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 22:41-46; Mark 12:35-37) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “Why do people say that the Messiah is the Son of David?  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>In the book of Psalms, David himself says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘The Lord God said to my Lord: </div><div class='q'>Sit by me at my right side, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>and I will put your enemies under your power.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> and I … power Literally, “until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”</span></a>’ <span class='rq'><a href='PSA110.htm#V1'>Psalm 110:1</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>David calls the Messiah ‘Lord.’ So how can the Messiah also be David’s son?” </div><div class='s'>Warning Against <br/> the Teachers of the Law </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 23:1-36; Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-54) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>While all the people were listening to Jesus, he said to his followers,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>“Be careful of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around wearing clothes that look important. And they love for people to show respect to them in the marketplaces. They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>But they cheat widows and take their homes. Then they try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers. God will punish them very much.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
