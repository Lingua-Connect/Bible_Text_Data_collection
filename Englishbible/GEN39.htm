They sold him to the captain of Pharaoh’s guard, Potiphar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The LORD helped Joseph become a successful man. Joseph lived in the house of his master, Potiphar the Egyptian. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Potiphar saw that the LORD was with Joseph and that the LORD helped Joseph be successful in everything he did.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Potiphar was very happy with Joseph. He allowed Joseph to work for him and to help him rule the house. Joseph was the ruler over everything Potiphar owned.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>After Joseph was made the ruler over the house, the LORD blessed the house and everything that Potiphar owned. The LORD also blessed everything that grew in Potiphar’s fields. The Lord did this because of Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Potiphar allowed Joseph to take responsibility for everything in the house.

He has given me responsibility for everything here.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>My master has made me almost equal to him in his house. I cannot sleep with his wife! That is wrong! It is a sin against God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The woman talked with Joseph every day, but he refused to sleep with her.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>One day Joseph went into the house to do his work. He was the only man in the house at the time.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His master’s wife grabbed his coat and said to him, “Come to bed with me.” But Joseph ran out of the house so fast that he left his coat in her hand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The woman saw that Joseph had left his coat in her hand and had run out of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>She called to the men outside and said, “Look! This Hebrew slave was brought here to make fun of us. He came in and tried to attack me, but I screamed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My scream scared him and he ran away, but he left his coat with me.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then she kept his coat until her husband, Joseph’s master, came home.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>She told her husband the same story.
