<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='s'>The Locusts </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh. I have made him and his officials stubborn. I did this so that I could show them my powerful miracles.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I also did this so that you could tell your children and your grandchildren about the miracles and other wonderful things that I have done in Egypt. Then all of you will know that I am the LORD.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They told him, “The LORD, the God of the Hebrews,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Hebrews Or “Israelites.” This name might also mean “descendants of Eber” (read Genesis 10:25-31) or “people from beyond the Euphrates River.”</span></a> says, ‘How long will you refuse to obey me? Let my people go to worship me!  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If you refuse to let my people go, then tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The locusts will cover the land. There will be so many locusts that you will not be able to see the ground. Anything that was left from the hailstorm will be eaten by the locusts. The locusts will eat all the leaves from every tree in the field.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They will fill all your houses, and all your officials’ houses, and all the houses in Egypt. There will be more locusts than your fathers or your grandfathers have ever seen. There will be more locusts than there have ever been since people began living in Egypt.’ ” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then the officials asked Pharaoh, “How long will we be trapped by these people? Let the men go to worship the LORD their God. If you don’t let them go, before you know it, Egypt will be destroyed!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Pharaoh told his officials to bring Moses and Aaron back to him. Pharaoh said to them, “Go and worship the LORD your God. But tell me, just who is going?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Moses answered, “All of our people, young and old, will go. And we will take our sons and daughters, and our sheep and cattle with us. We will all go because the LORD’S festival is for all of us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Pharaoh said to them, “The LORD really will have to be with you before I let you and all of your children leave Egypt. Look, you are planning something evil.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The men can go worship the LORD. That is what you asked for in the beginning. But all of your people cannot go.” Then Pharaoh sent Moses and Aaron away. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The LORD told Moses, “Raise your hand over the land of Egypt and the locusts will come! They will spread all over the land of Egypt and will eat all the plants that the hail did not destroy.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So Moses raised his walking stick over the land of Egypt, and the LORD caused a strong wind to blow from the east. The wind blew all that day and night. When morning came, the wind had brought the locusts to the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The locusts flew into the country of Egypt and landed on the ground. There were more locusts than there had ever been in Egypt. And there will never again be that many locusts there.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They covered the ground, and the whole country became dark. The locusts ate every plant on the ground and all the fruit in the trees that the hail had not destroyed. There were no leaves left on any of the trees or plants anywhere in Egypt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Pharaoh quickly called for Moses and Aaron. Pharaoh said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now, forgive me for my sins this time. Ask the LORD to remove this ‘death’ from me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So the LORD changed the wind. He made a very strong wind blow from the west, and it blew the locusts out of Egypt and into the Red Sea.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Red Sea Or “Reed Sea.” See 1 Kings 9:26.</span></a> Not one locust was left in Egypt!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the LORD caused Pharaoh to be stubborn again, and Pharaoh did not let the Israelites go. </div><div class='s'>The Darkness </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then the LORD told Moses, “Raise your hand into the air and darkness will cover Egypt. It will be so dark you can feel it!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Moses raised his hand into the air and a cloud of darkness covered Egypt. The darkness stayed in Egypt for three days.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>None of the people could see each other, and no one got up to go any place for three days. But there was light in all the places where the Israelites lived. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Again Pharaoh called for Moses. He said, “Go and worship the LORD! You can take your children with you. But you must leave your sheep and cattle here.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Moses said, “No, we will take them all. In fact, you will give us offerings and sacrifices for us to use in worshiping the LORD our God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Yes, we will take our animals with us to worship the LORD our God. Not one hoof will be left behind. We don’t know yet exactly what we will need to worship the LORD. We will learn that only when we get there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The LORD made Pharaoh stubborn again, so he refused to let them go.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh told Moses, “Get out of here. I don’t want you to come here again. The next time you come to see me, you will die!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Moses told Pharaoh, “You are right about one thing. I will not come to see you again.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
