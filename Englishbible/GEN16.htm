She had an Egyptian slave named Hagar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Sarai told Abram, “The LORD has not allowed me to have children, so sleep with my slave. Maybe she can have a son, and I will accept him as my own.” Abram did what Sarai said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So after living ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai gave her Egyptian slave to Abram as a second wife.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Abram slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When Hagar realized this, she became very proud and began to feel that she was better than Sarai her owner.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Sarai said to Abram, “My slave girl now hates me, and I blame you for this. I gave her to you, and she became pregnant. Then she began to feel that she is better than I am. I want the LORD to judge which of us is right.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Abram said to Sarai, “She is your slave. You can do anything you want to her.” So Sarai was cruel to Hagar, and Hagar ran away. </div><div class='s'>Hagar’s Son Ishmael </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring of water in the desert. The spring was by the road to Shur.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The angel said, “Hagar, Sarai’s slave girl, why are you here? Where are you going?” </div><div class='p'>Hagar said, “I am running away from Sarai.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The angel of the LORD said to her, “Sarai is your owner.
