He grew up like a young plant, like a root growing in dry ground. There was nothing special or impressive about the way he looked, nothing we could see that would cause us to like him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>People made fun of him, and even his friends left him. He was a man who suffered a lot of pain and sickness.

But we thought that God was punishing him, that God was beating him for something he did.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But he was being punished for what we did. He was crushed because of our guilt. He took the punishment we deserved, and this brought us peace. We were healed because of his pain.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We had all wandered away like sheep. We had gone our own way. And yet the LORD put all our guilt on him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He was treated badly, but he never protested. He said nothing, like a lamb being led away to be killed. He was like a sheep that makes no sound as its wool is being cut off.

I will give him the rewards of one who wins in battle, and he will share them with his powerful ones. I will do this because he gave his life for the people.
