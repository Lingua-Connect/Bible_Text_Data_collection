<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='s'>Jonathan Attacks the Philistines </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>That day, Saul’s son Jonathan was talking with the young man who carried his weapons. Jonathan said, “Let’s go to the Philistine camp on the other side of the valley.” But Jonathan did not tell his father. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Saul was sitting under a pomegranate tree at the threshing floor<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> at the threshing floor Or “in Migron.”</span></a> at the edge of the hill.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> edge of the hill Or “the edge of Gibeah.”</span></a> Saul had about 600 men with him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>One of the men was named Ahijah. Ahijah was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub. Ahitub was the son of Phinehas. Phinehas was the son of Eli. Eli had been the LORD’S priest at Shiloh. Now Ahijah was the priest who wore the ephod. </div><div class='p'>These men did not know that Jonathan had left.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jonathan was planning to go through a pass to get to the Philistine camp. There was a large rock on each side of the pass. The large rock on one side was named Bozez. The large rock on the other side was named Seneh.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>One of the rocks faced north toward Micmash, and the other faced south toward Geba. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jonathan said to his young helper who carried his weapons, “Come on, let’s go to the camp of those foreigners.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> foreigners Literally, “uncircumcised.” This means people who did not share in the agreement God made with Israel. See “circumcise, circumcision” in the Word List.</span></a> Maybe the LORD will use us to defeat them. Nothing can stop the LORD—it doesn’t matter if we have many soldiers or just a few soldiers.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The young man who carried Jonathan’s weapons said to him, “Do what you think is best. Whatever you decide, I am with you all the way.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jonathan said, “Let’s go! We’ll cross the valley and go to the Philistine guards. We’ll let them see us.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If they say to us, ‘Stay there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are. We won’t go up to them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But if the Philistine men say, ‘Come up here,’ then we will climb up to them. That will be a sign from God. That will mean that the LORD will allow us to defeat them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So Jonathan and his helper let the Philistines see them. The Philistine guards said, “Look! The Hebrews are coming out of the holes they were hiding in.”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The Philistines in the fort shouted to Jonathan and his helper, “Come up here. We’ll teach you a lesson.” </div><div class='p'>Jonathan said to his helper, “Follow me up the hill. The LORD is letting Israel defeat the Philistines.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13-14&#160;</span>So Jonathan climbed up the hill with his hands and feet, and his helper was right behind him. Jonathan and his helper attacked them. In the first attack, they killed 20 Philistines in an area about one-half acre in size. Jonathan fought the men who attacked from the front. His helper came behind him and killed the men who were only wounded. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Great fear spread among the Philistine soldiers—those in the field, in the camp, and at the fort. Even the bravest soldiers were afraid. The ground began to shake, and they were completely overcome with fear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Saul’s guards at Gibeah in the land of Benjamin saw the Philistine soldiers running away in different ways.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Saul said to the army with him, “Count the men. I want to know who left camp.” </div><div class='p'>They counted the men. Jonathan and his helper were gone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring God’s Holy Box!” (At that time God’s Holy Box was there with the Israelites.)<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The ancient Greek and Latin versions have “Saul said to Ahijah, ‘Bring the ephod!’ (At that time Ahijah was wearing the ephod.)”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Saul was talking to Ahijah the priest <span class='add'>waiting for advice from God</span>. But the noise and confusion in the Philistine camp was growing and growing. Saul was becoming impatient. Finally, he said to Ahijah the priest, “That’s enough. Put your hand down <span class='add'>and stop praying</span>.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Saul gathered his army together and went to the battle. The Philistine soldiers were very confused. They were even fighting each other with their swords.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There were Hebrews who served the Philistines in the past and who stayed in the Philistine camp. But now these Hebrews joined the Israelites with Saul and Jonathan.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>All the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard the Philistine soldiers were running away. So these Israelites also joined in the battle and began chasing the Philistines. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So the LORD saved the Israelites that day. The battle moved on past Beth Aven. The whole army was with Saul—he now had about 10,000 men. The battle spread to every city in the hill country of Ephraim.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The whole army … Ephraim This is from the ancient Greek version.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Saul Makes Another Mistake </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But Saul made a big mistake that day.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> But Saul … that day This is from the ancient Greek version. The standard Hebrew text has “The Israelites were very tired and hungry that day.”</span></a> He made this oath: “If any man eats food before evening comes, before I finish defeating my enemies, he will be under a curse.” He made the soldiers promise not to eat. So none of them ate anything. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25-26&#160;</span>Because of the fighting, the people went into some woods. Then they saw a honeycomb on the ground. The Israelites went up to the honeycomb, but they didn’t eat any of it. They were afraid to break the promise.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But Jonathan didn’t know about the oath. He didn’t hear his father make the soldiers promise not to eat. Jonathan had a stick in his hand, so he dipped the end of the stick into the honeycomb and pulled out some honey. He ate the honey and began to feel much better. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>One of the soldiers told Jonathan, “Your father forced the soldiers to make a special promise. He said that any man who eats today will be under a curse. So the men have not eaten anything. That’s why they are weak.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jonathan said, “My father has brought a lot of trouble to the land. See how much better I feel after tasting just a little of this honey.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>It would have been much better for the men to eat the food that they took from their enemies today. We could have killed more Philistines.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>That day the Israelites defeated the Philistines. They fought them all the way from Micmash to Aijalon. So the people were very tired and hungry.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They had taken sheep, cattle, and calves from the Philistines. Now they were so hungry that they killed the animals on the ground and ate them. And the blood was still in the animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Someone said to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the LORD. They’re eating meat that still has blood in it!” </div><div class='p'>Saul said, “You have sinned. Roll a large stone over here now!”  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then Saul said, “Go to the men and tell them that each one must bring his bull and sheep to me. Then the men must kill their bulls and sheep here. Don’t sin against the LORD! Don’t eat meat that still has blood in it.” </div><div class='p'>That night everyone brought their animals and killed them there.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Saul built an altar for the LORD. Saul himself began building that altar for the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Saul said, “Let’s go after the Philistines tonight. We will take everything from them. We will kill them all!” </div><div class='p'>The army answered, “Do whatever you think is best.” </div><div class='p'>But the priest said, “Let’s ask God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>So Saul asked God, “Should I go chase the Philistines? Will you let us defeat the Philistines?” But God did not answer Saul that day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>So Saul said, “Bring all the leaders to me! Let’s find who committed the sin today.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>I swear by the LORD who saves Israel, that even if my own son Jonathan sinned, he must die.” None of the people said a word. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then Saul said to all the Israelites, “You stand on this side. I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.” </div><div class='p'>The soldiers answered, “As you wish, sir.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then Saul prayed, “LORD, God of Israel, why haven’t you answered me today? Show us who sinned. If it was I or my son Jonathan, give Urim. But if it was your people Israel who sinned, give Thummim.”<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Then Samuel prayed … give Thummim This is found in the ancient Greek version. The standard Hebrew text has, “Then Samuel prayed to the Lord, God of Israel, ‘Give the right answer.’ ”</span></a> </div><div class='p'>Saul and Jonathan were shown to be the ones who sinned, and the people went free.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Saul said, “Throw them again to show the guilty one—me or my son Jonathan.” Jonathan was shown to be the one. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” </div><div class='p'>Jonathan told Saul, “I only tasted a little honey from the end of my stick. Should I die for doing that?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Saul said, “I made an oath and asked God to punish me if I didn’t keep it. Jonathan, you must die.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But the soldiers said to Saul, “Jonathan led Israel to a great victory today. Must Jonathan die? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not one hair of Jonathan’s head will fall to the ground! God helped Jonathan fight against the Philistines today.” So the people saved Jonathan from death. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Saul did not chase the Philistines. The Philistines went back to their place. </div><div class='s'>Saul Fights Israel’s Enemies </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Saul took full control of Israel and fought all the enemies who lived around Israel. Saul fought Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the king of Zobah, and the Philistines. He defeated Israel’s enemies wherever he went.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Saul was very brave. He saved Israel from all the enemies who tried to take things from the Israelites. He even defeated the Amalekites. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki Shua. Saul’s older daughter was named Merab. Saul’s younger daughter was named Michal.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Saul’s wife was named Ahinoam. Ahinoam was the daughter of Ahimaaz. </div><div class='p'>The commander of Saul’s army was named Abner son of Ner. Ner was Saul’s uncle.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Saul was brave all his life. He fought hard against the Philistines. Any time Saul saw a man who was strong or brave, he took that man and put him into the group of soldiers who stayed near the king and protected him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
