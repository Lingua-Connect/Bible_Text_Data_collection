I will let them take this land.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The men of Judah went to their relatives from the tribe of Simeon and asked for help. They said, “Brothers, if you will come and help us fight for the land God gave us, we will go and help you fight for your land.” The men of Simeon agreed and went with them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The LORD helped the men of Judah defeat the Canaanites and the Perizzites. They killed 10,000 men at the city of Bezek.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In the city of Bezek, they found the ruler of Bezek<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> ruler of Bezek Or “Adoni Bezek.”</span></a> and fought him, and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The ruler of Bezek tried to escape, but the men of Judah chased him and caught him. When they caught him, they cut off his thumbs and big toes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then the ruler of Bezek said, “I cut off the thumbs and big toes of 70 kings. And they had to eat pieces of food that fell from my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” The men of Judah took the ruler of Bezek to Jerusalem, and he died there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They used their swords to kill the people of Jerusalem. Then they burned the city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Later, they went down to fight against some more Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the western foothills. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the men of Judah went to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the city of Hebron. (Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba.) They defeated the men named Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Sheshai, Ahiman, Talmai Three sons of a man named Anak. They were giants. See Num. 13:22.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Caleb and His Daughter </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The men of Judah left that place. They went to the city of Debir to fight against the people there. (In the past, Debir was called Kiriath Sepher.)  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Before they started to fight, Caleb made a promise to the men. He said, “I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to whoever attacks and conquers Kiriath Sepher.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Caleb had a younger brother named Kenaz. Kenaz had a son named Othniel. Othniel captured the city of Kiriath Sepher. So Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to Othniel to be his wife. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Acsah went to live with Othniel. Othniel told Acsah<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Othniel told Acsah Or “Acsah told Othniel.”</span></a> to ask her father for some land. She went to her father. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What is wrong?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Acsah answered him, “Give me a blessing.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Give me a blessing Or “Please welcome me” or “Give me a stream of water.”</span></a> You gave me dry desert land in the Negev. Please give me some land with water on it.” So Caleb gave her what she wanted. He gave her the upper and lower pools of water in that land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The Kenites left the City of Palm Trees<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> City of Palm Trees Another name for Jericho.</span></a> and went with the men of Judah. They went to the desert of Judah to live with the people there. This was in the Negev near the city Arad. (The Kenites were from the family of Moses’ father-in-law.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Some Canaanites lived in the city of Zephath. The men of Judah and men from the tribe of Simeon attacked them and completely destroyed the city. So they named the city Hormah.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Hormah This name means “completely destroyed” or “a gift given totally to God.” See Leviticus 27:28-29.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The men of Judah also captured the cities of Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron and all the small towns around them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The LORD was on the side of the men of Judah when they fought. They took the land in the hill country, but they failed to take the land in the valleys, because the people living there had iron chariots. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moses had promised to give the land near Hebron to Caleb, so that land was given to Caleb’s family. The men of Caleb forced the three sons of Anak<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> three sons of Anak Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, mentioned above in verse 10.</span></a> to leave that place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The tribe of Benjamin could not force the Jebusites to leave Jerusalem. So even today,<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> even today That is, at the time the book was written.</span></a> the Jebusites live with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem. </div><div class='s'>Joseph’s Descendants Capture Bethel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The descendants of Joseph went to fight against the city of Bethel, and the LORD was with them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They sent some spies to the city of Bethel (which was then called Luz).  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>While the spies were watching, they saw a man come out of the city. They said to the man, “Show us a secret way into the city. If you help us, we will not hurt you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The man showed the spies the secret way into the city. The men of Joseph used their swords to kill the people of Bethel. But they did not hurt the man who helped them or anyone in his family. The man and his family were allowed to go free.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He went to the land where the Hittites lived and built a city. He named it Luz, and that city is still called Luz today. </div><div class='s'>Other Tribes Fight the Canaanites </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>There were Canaanites living in the cities of Beth Shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and the small towns around the cities. The people from the tribe of Manasseh could not force those people to leave their towns. So the Canaanites stayed. They refused to leave their homes.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Later, the Israelites grew stronger and forced the Canaanites to work as slaves for them. But the Israelites could not force all the Canaanites to leave their land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>There were Canaanites living in Gezer. And the Ephraimites did not make all the Canaanites leave their land. So they continued to live in Gezer with the Ephraimites. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Some Canaanites lived in the cities of Kitron and Nahalol. The people of Zebulun did not force those people to leave their land. They stayed and lived with the people of Zebulun. But the people of Zebulun made them work as slaves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The people of Asher did not force the other people to leave the cities of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphek, and Rehob.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The people of Asher did not force those Canaanites to leave their land, so the Canaanites continued to live with them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The people of Naphtali did not force the people to leave the cities of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath, so the people of Naphtali continued to live with the people in those cities. Those Canaanites worked as slaves for the people of Naphtali. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The Amorites forced the tribe of Dan to live in the hill country. They had to stay in the hills because the Amorites would not let them come down to live in the valleys.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The Amorites decided to stay in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. Later, when the descendants of Joseph grew stronger, they made the Amorites work as slaves for them.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The land of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and up into the hill country past Sela. </div><ul class='tnav'>
