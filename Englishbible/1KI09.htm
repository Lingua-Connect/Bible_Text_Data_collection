<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='s'>God Comes to Solomon Again </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So Solomon finished building the LORD’S Temple and his own palace. Solomon built everything that he wanted to build.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then the LORD appeared to Solomon again, just as he did at Gibeon.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The LORD said to him, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='pi'>“I heard your prayer and what you asked me to do. You built this Temple, and I have made it a holy place. So I will be honored there forever. I will watch over it and think of it always.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You must serve me with a pure and honest heart, just as your father David did. You must obey my laws and do everything that I commanded you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If you do, I will make sure that your family will always rule Israel, just as I promised your father David when I told him that Israel would always be ruled by one of his descendants. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6-7&#160;</span>“But if you or your children stop following me, and don’t obey the laws and commands that I have given you, and if you serve and worship other gods, I will force Israel to leave the land that I have given to them. Israel will be an example to other people. Other people will make jokes about Israel. I made the Temple holy. It is the place where people honor me. But I will tear it down.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This Temple will be destroyed. Everyone who sees it will be amazed. They will ask, ‘Why did the LORD do this terrible thing to this land and to this temple?’  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>People will say, ‘This happened because they left the LORD their God. He brought their ancestors out of Egypt, but they decided to follow other gods. They worshiped and served those gods. That is why the LORD caused all these bad things to happen to them.’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>It took 20 years for King Solomon to build the LORD’S Temple and the king’s palace.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Hiram supplied Solomon with all the cedar, pine and gold that he wanted, so Solomon gave him 20 cities in Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So Hiram traveled from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him. But Hiram was not pleased when he saw them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>King Hiram said, “What are these towns that you have given me, my brother?” King Hiram named that land the Land of Cabul.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Cabul This name is like the Hebrew word meaning “worthless.”</span></a> And that area is still called Cabul today.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Hiram had sent King Solomon about 9000 pounds<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 9000 pounds Literally, “120 talents” (4140 kg).</span></a> of gold to use in building the Temple. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>King Solomon forced slaves to work for him to build the Temple and his palace. Then he used these slaves to build many other things. He built the Millo and the city wall around Jerusalem. Then he rebuilt the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In the past the king of Egypt had fought against the city of Gezer and burned it. He killed the Canaanites who lived there. When Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter, Pharaoh gave him that city as a wedding present.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the city of Lower Beth Horon.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He also built the cities of Baalath and Tamar in the Judean desert.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He also built cities where he could store grain, and he built places for his chariots and his horses. King Solomon also built whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and all the places he ruled. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There were people left in the land who were not Israelites. There were Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Israelites had not been able to destroy them, but Solomon forced them to work for him as slaves. They are still slaves today.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Solomon did not force any Israelites to be his slaves. The Israelites were soldiers, government officials, officers, captains, and chariot commanders and drivers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There were 550 supervisors over Solomon’s projects. They supervised the men who did the work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Pharaoh’s daughter moved from the City of David to the palace that Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Three times each year Solomon offered burned sacrifices and fellowship offerings on the altar that he built for the LORD. King Solomon also burned incense before the LORD and supplied what was needed for the Temple. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber. This town is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>King Hiram had some skilled sailors who knew the sea well. He sent them to serve in Solomon’s navy and work with Solomon’s men.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Solomon’s ships went to Ophir and brought back about 16 tons<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> 16 tons Literally, “420 talents” (14,490 kg).</span></a> of gold for him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
