So gather your family, and all of you go into the boat.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Get seven pairs (seven males and seven females) of every kind of clean animal. And get one pair (one male and one female) of every other animal on the earth. Lead all these animals into the boat with you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Get seven pairs (seven males and seven females) of all the birds. This will allow all these animals to continue living on the earth after the other animals are destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Seven days from now, I will send much rain on the earth. It will rain for 40 days and 40 nights, and I will wipe everything off the face of the earth. I will destroy everything I made.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Noah did everything the LORD told him to do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Noah was 600 years old at the time the rains came.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He and his family went into the boat to be saved from the flood.

These animals went into the boat in groups of two, male and female, just as God commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Seven days later the flood started. The rain began to fall on the earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11-13&#160;</span>On the 17th day of the second month, when Noah was 600 years old, the springs under the earth broke through the ground, and water flowed out everywhere. The sky also opened like windows and rain poured down. The rain fell on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights. That same day Noah went into the boat with his wife, his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They and every kind of animal on the earth were in the boat. Every kind of cattle, every kind of animal that crawls on the earth, and every kind of bird were in the boat.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All these animals went into the boat with Noah. They came in groups of two from every kind of animal that had the breath of life.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>All these animals went into the boat in groups of two, just as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD closed the door behind Noah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Water flooded the earth for 40 days.
