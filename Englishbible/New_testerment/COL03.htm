<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='s'>Your New Life </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>You were raised from death with Christ. So live for what is in heaven, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Think only about what is up there, not what is here on earth.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Your old self has died, and your new life is kept with Christ in God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Yes, Christ is now your life, and when he comes again, you will share in his glory. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So put everything evil out of your life: sexual sin, doing anything immoral, letting sinful thoughts control you, and wanting things that are wrong. And don’t keep wanting more and more for yourself, which is the same as worshiping a false god.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>God will show his anger against those who don’t obey him,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> against … him Some Greek copies do not have these words.</span></a> because they do these evil things.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You also did these things in the past, when you lived like them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But now put these things out of your life: anger, losing your temper, doing or saying things to hurt others, and saying shameful things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Don’t lie to each other. You have taken off those old clothes—the person you once were and the bad things you did then.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now you are wearing a new life, a life that is new every day. You are growing in your understanding of the one who made you. You are becoming more and more like him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In this new life it doesn’t matter if you are a Greek or a Jew, circumcised or not. It doesn’t matter if you speak a different language or even if you are a Scythian.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Scythians Known as wild and uncivilized people.</span></a> It doesn’t matter if you are a slave or free. Christ is all that matters, and he is in all of you. </div><div class='s'>Your New Life With Each Other </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>God has chosen you and made you his holy people. He loves you. So your new life should be like this: Show mercy to others. Be kind, humble, gentle, and patient.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Don’t be angry with each other, but forgive each other. If you feel someone has wronged you, forgive them. Forgive others because the Lord forgave you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Together with these things, the most important part of your new life is to love each other. Love is what holds everything together in perfect unity.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let the peace that Christ gives control your thinking. It is for peace that you were chosen to be together in one body.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> body Christ’s spiritual body, meaning the church—his people.</span></a> And always be thankful. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let the teaching of Christ live inside you richly. Use all wisdom to teach and counsel each other. Sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Everything you say and everything you do should be done for Jesus your Lord. And in all you do, give thanks to God the Father through Jesus. </div><div class='s'>Your New Life at Home </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Wives, be willing to serve your husbands. This is the right thing to do in following the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Husbands, love your wives, and be gentle to them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Children, obey your parents in everything. This pleases the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Fathers, don’t upset your children. If you are too hard to please, they might want to stop trying. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Servants, obey your masters in everything. Obey all the time, even when they can’t see you. Don’t just pretend to work hard so that they will treat you well. No, you must serve your masters honestly because you respect the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In all the work you are given, do the best you can. Work as though you are working for the Lord, not any earthly master.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Remember that you will receive your reward from the Lord, who will give you what he promised his people. Yes, you are serving Christ. He is your real Master.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Yes, you … Master Or “Serve the Lord Christ.” The Greek word translated “Lord” is the same as the word for “master” in verses 22 and 23.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Remember that anyone who does wrong will be punished for that wrong.
