<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='s'>The Woman Giving Birth <br/> and the Dragon </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And then a great wonder appeared in heaven: There was a woman who was clothed with the sun, and the moon was under her feet. She had a crown of twelve stars on her head.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>She was pregnant and cried out with pain because she was about to give birth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then another wonder appeared in heaven: There was a giant red dragon there. The dragon had seven heads with a crown on each head. It also had ten horns.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth. It stood in front of the woman who was ready to give birth to the baby. It wanted to eat the woman’s baby as soon as it was born. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The woman gave birth to a son, who would rule all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was taken up to God and to his throne.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The woman ran away into the desert to a place that God had prepared for her. There she would be taken care of for 1260 days. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then there was a war in heaven. Michael<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Michael The archangel—leader of God’s angels. See Jude 9.</span></a> and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and its angels fought back,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>but they were not strong enough. The dragon and its angels lost their place in heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>It was thrown down out of heaven. (This giant dragon is that old snake, the one called the devil or Satan, who leads the whole world into the wrong way.) The dragon and its angels were thrown to the earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say, “The victory and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Messiah have now come. These things have come, because the accuser of our brothers and sisters has been thrown out. He is the one who accused them day and night before our God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They defeated him by the blood sacrifice of the Lamb and by the message of God that they told people. They did not love their lives too much. They were not afraid of death.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So rejoice, you heavens and all who live there! But it will be terrible for the earth and sea, because the devil has gone down to you. He is filled with anger. He knows he doesn’t have much time.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth. So he chased the woman who had given birth to the child.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle. Then she could fly to the place that was prepared for her in the desert. There she would be taken care of for three and a half years. There she would be away from the dragon.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> dragon Here and in verse 15 literally, “snake.” See verse 9 above.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the dragon poured water out of its mouth like a river. It poured the water toward the woman so that the flood would carry her away.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But the earth helped the woman. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that came from the mouth of the dragon.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then the dragon was very angry with the woman. It went away to make war against all her other children. Her children are those who obey God’s commands and have the truth that Jesus taught. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The dragon stood on the seashore. </div><ul class='tnav'>
