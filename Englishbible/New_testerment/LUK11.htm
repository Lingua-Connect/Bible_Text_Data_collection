<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='s'>Jesus Teaches About Prayer </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 6:9-15) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>One time Jesus was out praying, and when he finished, one of his followers said to him, “John taught his followers how to pray. Lord, teach us how to pray too.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jesus said to the followers, “This is how you should pray: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘Father, we pray that your name will always be kept holy. </div><div class='q2'>We pray that your kingdom will come. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Give us the food we need for each day. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Forgive our sins, </div><div class='q2'>just as we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us. </div><div class='q'>And don’t let us be tempted.’ ” </div><div class='s'>Ask God for What You Need </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 7:7-11) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5-6&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you went to your friend’s house very late at night and said to him, ‘A friend of mine has come into town to visit me. But I have nothing for him to eat. Please give me three loaves of bread.’  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your friend inside the house answers, ‘Go away! Don’t bother me! The door is already locked. My children and I are in bed. I cannot get up and give you the bread now.’  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I tell you, maybe friendship is not enough to make him get up to give you the bread. But he will surely get up to give you what you need if you continue to ask.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So I tell you, continue to ask, and God will give to you. Continue to search, and you will find. Continue to knock, and the door will open for you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yes, whoever continues to ask will receive. Whoever continues to look will find. And whoever continues to knock will have the door opened for them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Do any of you have a son? What would you do if your son asked you for a fish? Would any father give him a snake?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Or, if he asked for an egg, would you give him a scorpion? Of course not!  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Even you who are bad know how to give good things to your children. So surely your heavenly Father knows how to give the Holy Spirit to the people who ask him.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus’ Power Is From God </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 12:22-30; Mark 3:20-27) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>One time Jesus was sending a demon out of a man who could not talk. When the demon came out, the man was able to speak. The crowds were amazed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But some of the people said, “He uses the power of Satan<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Satan Literally, “Beelzebul” (the devil). Also in verses 18, 19.</span></a> to force demons out of people. Satan is the ruler of demons.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Some others there wanted to test Jesus. They asked him to do a miracle as a sign from God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But he knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, “Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. And a family that fights against itself will break apart.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So if Satan is fighting against himself, how will his kingdom survive? You say that I use the power of Satan to force out demons.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But if I use Satan’s power to force out demons, then what power do your people use when they force out demons? So your own people will prove that you are wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But I use the power of God to force out demons. This shows that God’s kingdom has now come to you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“When a strong man with many weapons guards his own house, the things in his house are safe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But suppose a stronger man comes and defeats him. The stronger man will take away the weapons that the first man trusted to keep his house safe. Then the stronger man will do what he wants with the other man’s things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“Whoever is not with me is against me. And anyone who does not work with me is working against me. </div><div class='s'>The Danger of Emptiness </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 12:43-45) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>“When an evil spirit comes out of someone, it travels through dry places, looking for a place to rest. But it finds no place to rest. So it says, ‘I will go back to the home I left.’  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When it comes back, it finds that home all neat and clean.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the evil spirit goes out and brings back seven other spirits more evil than itself. They all go and live there, and that person has even more trouble than before.” </div><div class='s'>The People God Blesses </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As Jesus was saying these things, a woman with the people there called out to him, “Blessings from God belong to the woman who gave birth to you and fed you!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But Jesus said, “The people who hear the teaching of God and obey it—they are the ones who have God’s blessing.” </div><div class='s'>Some People Doubt Jesus’ Authority </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 12:38-42; Mark 8:12) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The crowd grew larger and larger. Jesus said, “The people who live today are evil. They ask for a miracle as a sign from God. But no miracle will be done to prove anything to them. The only sign will be the miracle that happened to Jonah.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Jonah A prophet in the Old Testament. After three days in a big fish he came out alive, just as Jesus would come out from the tomb on the third day.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Jonah was a sign for those who lived in Nineveh.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Nineveh City where Jonah preached. See Jonah 3.</span></a> It is the same with the Son of Man. He will be a sign for the people of this time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>“On the judgment day, you people who live now will be compared with the Queen of the South,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Queen of the South Or “Queen of Sheba.” She traveled about 1000 miles (1600 km) to learn God’s wisdom from Solomon. See 1 Kings 10:1-13.</span></a> and she will be a witness who shows how guilty you are. Why do I say this? Because she traveled from far, far away to listen to Solomon’s wise teaching. And I tell you that someone<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> someone Literally, “something.” Also in verse 32.</span></a> greater than Solomon is right here, but you won’t listen! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>“On the judgment day, you people who live now will also be compared with the people from Nineveh, and they will be witnesses who show how guilty you are. I say this because when Jonah preached to those people, they changed their hearts and lives. And you are listening to someone greater than Jonah, but you refuse to change! </div><div class='s'>Be a Light for the World </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 5:15; 6:22-23) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>“No one takes a light and puts it under a bowl or hides it. Instead, they put it on a lampstand so that the people who come in can see.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The only source of light for the body is the eye. When you look at people and want to help them, you are full of light. But when you look at people in a selfish way, you are full of darkness.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Literally, “The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is pure, your whole body is full of light. But if it is evil, your body is dark.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So be careful! Don’t let the light in you become darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>If you are full of light, and there is no part of you that is dark, then you will be all bright, as though you have the light of a lamp shining on you.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Criticizes the Religious Leaders </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 23:1-36; Mark 12:38-40; Luke 20:45-47) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>After Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee asked Jesus to eat with him. So he went and took a place at the table.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But the Pharisee was surprised when he saw that Jesus did not wash his hands<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> wash his hands Washing the hands was a Jewish religious custom that the Pharisees thought was very important.</span></a> first before the meal.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The Lord said to him, “The washing you Pharisees do is like cleaning only the outside of a cup or a dish. But what is inside you? You want only to cheat and hurt people.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>You are foolish! The same one who made what is outside also made what is inside.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>So pay attention to what is inside. Give to the people who need help. Then you will be fully clean. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>“But it will be bad for you Pharisees! You give God a tenth of the food you get, even your mint, your rue, and every other little plant in your garden.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> You give … garden Literally, “You tithe mint, rue, and every herb.” The Law of Moses required Israelites to share their food supply by dedicating a tenth of their field crops and livestock to God (see Leviticus 27:30-32; Deuteronomy 26:12). This did not include such small garden plants as those mentioned here. So these Pharisees were giving more than required to be sure they were not breaking the Law.</span></a> But you forget to be fair to others and to love God. These are the things you should do. And you should also continue to do those other things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>“It will be bad for you Pharisees because you love to have the most important seats in the synagogues. And you love for people to show respect to you in the marketplaces.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>It will be bad for you, because you are like hidden graves. People walk on them without knowing it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>One of the experts in the law said to Jesus, “Teacher, when you say these things about the Pharisees, you are criticizing our group too.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “It will be bad for you, you experts in the law! You make strict rules that are very hard for people to obey.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> You make … obey Literally, “You put heavy burdens on people that are hard for them to carry.”</span></a> You try to force others to obey your rules. But you yourselves don’t even try to follow any of those rules.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>It will be bad for you, because you build tombs for the prophets. But these are the same prophets your ancestors killed!  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And now you show all people that you agree with what your ancestors did. They killed the prophets, and you build tombs for the prophets!  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>This is why God in his wisdom said, ‘I will send prophets and apostles<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> prophets and apostles People chosen by God to tell his Good News to the world.</span></a> to them. Some of my prophets and apostles will be killed by evil men. Others will be treated badly.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>“So you people who live now will be punished for the deaths of all the prophets who were killed since the beginning of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>You will be punished for the killing of Abel.<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Abel In the Hebrew Old Testament, the first person to be murdered.</span></a> And you will be punished for the killing of Zechariah,<a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Zechariah In the Hebrew Old Testament, the last person to be murdered.</span></a> who was killed between the altar and the Temple.

You have taken away the key to learning about God. You yourselves would not learn, and you stopped others from learning too.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>When Jesus went out, the teachers of the law and the Pharisees began to give him much trouble. They tried to make him answer questions about many things.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>They were trying to find a way to catch Jesus saying something wrong. </div><ul class='tnav'>
