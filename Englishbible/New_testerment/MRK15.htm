They tied him, led him away, and handed him over to Governor Pilate. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” </div><div class='p'>Jesus answered, “Yes, that is right.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The leading priests accused Jesus of many things.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Pilate asked Jesus another question. He said, “You can see that these people are accusing you of many things. Why don’t you answer?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But Jesus still did not answer, and this really surprised Pilate. </div><div class='s'>Pilate Tries but Fails to Free Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:15-31; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39—19:16) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Every year at the Passover time the governor would free one prisoner—whichever one the people wanted.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There was a man in prison at that time named Barabbas. He and the rebels with him had been put in prison for committing murder during a riot. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The people came to Pilate and asked him to free a prisoner as he always did.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to free the king of the Jews?”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Pilate knew that the leading priests had handed Jesus over to him because they were jealous of him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the leading priests persuaded the people to ask Pilate to free Barabbas, not Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Pilate asked the people again, “So what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The people shouted, “Kill him on a cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Pilate asked, “Why? What wrong has he done?” </div><div class='p'>But the people shouted louder and louder, “Kill him on a cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Pilate wanted to please the people, so he set Barabbas free for them. And he told the soldiers to beat Jesus with whips. Then he handed him over to the soldiers to be killed on a cross. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Pilate’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace (called the Praetorium). They called all the other soldiers together.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They put a purple robe on Jesus, made a crown from thorny branches, and put it on his head.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then they began shouting, “Welcome, king of the Jews!”  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They kept on beating his head with a stick and spitting on him. Then they bowed down on their knees and pretended to honor him as a king.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>After they finished making fun of him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him out of the palace to be killed on a cross. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:32-44; Luke 23:26-39; John 19:17-19) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There was a man from Cyrene named Simon walking into the city from the fields. He was the father of Alexander and Rufus. The soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’ cross.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They led Jesus to the place called Golgotha. (Golgotha means “The Place of the Skull.”)  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There they gave him some wine mixed with myrrh, but he refused to drink it.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The soldiers nailed Jesus to a cross. Then they divided his clothes among themselves, throwing dice to see who would get what. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>It was nine o’clock in the morning when they nailed Jesus to the cross.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There was a sign with the charge against him written on it. It said, “<span class='sc'>the king of the jews</span>.”  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They also nailed two criminals to crosses beside Jesus—one on the right and the other on the left.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Some Greek copies add verse 28: “And this showed the full meaning of the Scripture that says, ‘They put him with criminals.’ ”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>People walked by and said bad things to Jesus. They shook their heads and said, “You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So save yourself! Come down from that cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The leading priests and the teachers of the law were also there. They made fun of Jesus the same as the other people did. They said to each other, “He saved others, but he can’t save himself!  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If he is really the Messiah, the king of Israel, he should come down from the cross now. When we see this, then we will believe in him.” The criminals on the crosses beside Jesus also said bad things to him. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Dies </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:45-56; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>At noon the whole country became dark. This darkness continued until three o’clock.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>At three o’clock Jesus cried out loudly, <span class='tl'>“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani.”</span> This means “My God, my God, why have you left me alone?”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Psalm 22:1.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Some of the people standing there heard this.

He filled the sponge with sour wine and tied it to a stick. Then he used the stick to give the sponge to Jesus to get a drink from it. The man said, “We should wait now and see if Elijah will come to take him down from the cross.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then Jesus cried out loudly and died. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>When Jesus died, the curtain in the Temple was torn into two pieces. The tear started at the top and tore all the way to the bottom.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The army officer who was standing there in front of the cross saw what happened when Jesus died. The officer said, “This man really was the Son of God!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Some women were standing away from the cross, watching. Among these women were Mary Magdalene, Salome, and Mary the mother of James and Joses. (James was her youngest son.)  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>These were the women who had followed Jesus in Galilee and cared for him. Many other women who had come with Jesus to Jerusalem were also there. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Buried </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:57-61; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>This day was called Preparation day. (That means the day before the Sabbath day.) It was becoming dark.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>A man named Joseph from Arimathea was brave enough to go to Pilate and ask for Jesus’ body. Joseph was an important member of the high council. He was one of the people who wanted God’s kingdom to come. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead.
