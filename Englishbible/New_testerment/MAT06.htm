Don’t be like the hypocrites. When they are in the synagogues and on the streets, they blow trumpets before they give so that people will see them. They want everyone to praise them. The truth is, that’s all the reward they will get.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So when you give to the poor, don’t let anyone know what you are doing.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> don’t … doing Literally, “don’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Your giving should be done in private.

They love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners and pray loudly. They want people to see them. The truth is, that’s all the reward they will get.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But when you pray, you should go into your room and close the door. Then pray to your Father. He is there in that private place.

They say the same things again and again. They think that if they say it enough, their god will hear them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Don’t be like them.

They put a look of suffering on their faces so that people will see they are fasting.

He can see what is done in private, and he will reward you. </div><div class='s'>You Cannot Serve Two Masters </div><div class='r'>(Luke 12:33-34; 11:34-36; 16:13) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“Don’t save treasures for yourselves here on earth. Moths and rust will destroy them. And thieves can break into your house and steal them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Instead, save your treasures in heaven, where they cannot be destroyed by moths or rust and where thieves cannot break in and steal them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Your heart will be where your treasure is. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“The only source of light for the body is the eye. If you look at people and want to help them, you will be full of light.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But if you look at people in a selfish way, you will be full of darkness. And if the only light you have is really darkness, you have the worst kind of darkness.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Literally, “22 The lamp of the body is the eye.

Life is more important than food, and the body is more important than what you put on it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Look at the birds. They don’t plant, harvest, or save food in barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Don’t you know you are worth much more than they are?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>You cannot add any time to your life by worrying about it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“And why do you worry about clothes? Look at the wildflowers in the field. See how they grow. They don’t work or make clothes for themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But I tell you that even Solomon, the great and rich king, was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>If God makes what grows in the field so beautiful, what do you think he will do for you? It’s just grass—one day it’s alive, and the next day someone throws it into a fire. But God cares enough to make it beautiful. Surely he will do much more for you. Your faith is so small! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>“Don’t worry and say, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>That’s what those people who don’t know God are always thinking about. Don’t worry, because your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>What you should want most is God’s kingdom and doing what he wants you to do. Then he will give you all these other things you need.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So don’t worry about tomorrow. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Tomorrow will have its own worries. </div><ul class='tnav'>
