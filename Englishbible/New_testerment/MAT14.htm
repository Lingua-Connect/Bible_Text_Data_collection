<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='s'>Herod Thinks Jesus Is John the Baptizer </div><div class='r'>(Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>About that time, Herod, the ruler of Galilee, heard what the people were saying about Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So he said to his servants, “This man is really John the Baptizer. He must have risen from death, and that is why he can do these miracles.” </div><div class='s'>How John the Baptizer Was Killed </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Before this time, Herod had arrested John. He had him chained and put in prison. He arrested John because of Herodias, the wife of Philip, Herod’s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>John had told him, “It is not right for you to be married to Herodias.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Herod wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people. They believed that John was a prophet. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>On Herod’s birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced for him and his group. Herod was very pleased with her.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So he promised that he would give her anything she wanted.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Herodias told her daughter what to ask for. So she said to Herod, “Give me the head of John the Baptizer here on this plate.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>King Herod was very sad. But he had promised to give the daughter anything she wanted. And the people eating with Herod had heard his promise. So he ordered what she asked to be done.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He sent men to the prison, where they cut off John’s head.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the men brought John’s head on a plate and gave it to the girl. Then she took the head to her mother, Herodias.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>John’s followers came and got his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what happened. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Feeds More Than 5000 </div><div class='r'>(Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When Jesus heard what happened to John, he left in a boat. He went alone to a place where no one lived. But the people heard that Jesus had left. So they left their towns and followed him. They went by land to the same place he went.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When Jesus got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd of people. He felt sorry for them, and he healed the ones who were sick. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Late that afternoon, the followers came to Jesus and said, “No one lives in this place. And it is already late. Send the people away so they can go to the towns and buy food for themselves.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus said, “The people don’t need to go away. You give them some food to eat.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The followers answered, “But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Bring the bread and the fish to me.”  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then he told the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish. He looked into the sky and thanked God for the food. Then he broke the bread into pieces, which he gave to the followers, and they gave the food to the people.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Everyone ate until they were full. When they finished eating, the followers filled twelve baskets with the pieces of food that were not eaten.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There were about 5000 men there who ate. There were also women and children who ate. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Walks on Water </div><div class='r'>(Mark 6:45-52; John 6:16-21) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Jesus made the followers get into the boat. He told them to go to the other side of the lake. He said he would come later. He stayed there to tell everyone they could go home.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>After Jesus said goodbye to the people, he went up into the hills by himself to pray. It was late, and he was there alone.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>By this time the boat was already a long way from shore. Since the wind was blowing against it, the boat was having trouble because of the waves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Between three and six o’clock in the morning, Jesus’ followers were still in the boat. Jesus came to them. He was walking on the water.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When they saw him walking on the water, it scared them. “It’s a ghost!” they said, screaming in fear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But Jesus quickly spoke to them. He said, “Don’t worry! It’s me! Don’t be afraid.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Peter said, “Lord, if that is really you, tell me to come to you on the water.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Come, Peter.” </div><div class='p'>Then Peter left the boat and walked on the water to Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But while Peter was walking on the water, he saw the wind and the waves. He was afraid and began sinking into the water. He shouted, “Lord, save me!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Jesus caught Peter with his hand. He said, “Your faith is small. Why did you doubt?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>After Peter and Jesus were in the boat, the wind stopped.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then the followers in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, “You really are the Son of God.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many Sick People </div><div class='r'>(Mark 6:53-56) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>After they crossed the lake, they came to the shore at Gennesaret.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Some men there saw Jesus and knew who he was. So they sent word to the other people throughout that area that Jesus had come. The people brought all their sick people to him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>They begged Jesus to let them only touch the edge of his coat to be healed. And all the sick people who touched his coat were healed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
