See Gal. 2:12.</span></a> argued with him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They said, “You went into the homes of people who are not Jews and are not circumcised, and you even ate with them!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Peter explained the whole story to them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He said, “I was in the city of Joppa. While I was praying, I had a vision. I saw something coming down from heaven. It looked like a big sheet being lowered to the ground by its four corners. It came down close to me,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and I looked inside. I saw all kinds of animals, including wild ones, as well as reptiles and birds.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I heard a voice say to me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill anything here and eat it!’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“But I said, ‘I can’t do that, Lord! I have never eaten anything that is not pure or fit to be used for food.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“But the voice from heaven answered again, ‘God has made these things pure. Don’t say they are unfit to eat!’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“This happened three times. Then the whole thing was taken back into heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Suddenly there were three men standing outside the house where I was staying. They had been sent from Caesarea to get me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The Spirit told me to go with them without wondering if it was all right. These six brothers here also went with me, and we went to the house of Cornelius.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He told us about the angel he had seen standing in his house. The angel said, ‘Send some men to Joppa to get Simon, the one who is also called Peter.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He will speak to you, and what he tells you will save you and everyone living in your house.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“After I began speaking, the Holy Spirit came on them just as he came on us at the beginning.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> beginning The day of Pentecost described in Acts 2, when the Holy Spirit came on Jesus’ first followers to give them power to begin their work of telling the world the Good News of salvation through Jesus.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then I remembered the words of the Lord Jesus: ‘John baptized people in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.’  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>God gave these people the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. So how could I object to what God wanted to do?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When the Jewish believers heard this, they stopped arguing. They praised God and said, “So God is also allowing even those who are not Jews to change their hearts so that they can have the life he gives!” </div><div class='s'>The Good News Comes to Antioch </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The believers were scattered by the persecution<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> persecution A time when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem were punishing people who believed in Christ. See Acts 8:1-4.</span></a> that began when Stephen was killed. Some of them went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They told the Good News in these places, but only to Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Some of these believers were men from Cyprus and Cyrene. When these men came to Antioch, they began speaking to people who were not Jews.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> people who were not Jews Literally, “Hellenists,” meaning people who have been influenced by Greek culture. Some Greek copies have “Greeks.”</span></a> They told them the Good News about the Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Lord was helping these men, and a large number of people believed and decided to follow the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When the church in Jerusalem heard about this, they sent Barnabas to Antioch.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23-24&#160;</span>Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith. When he went to Antioch and saw how God had blessed the believers there, he was very happy. He encouraged them all, saying, “Always be faithful to the Lord. Serve him with all your heart.” Many more people became followers of the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Barnabas went to the city of Tarsus to look for Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. They stayed there a whole year. Every time the church came together, Barnabas and Saul met with them and taught many people. It was in Antioch that the followers of the Lord Jesus were called “Christ-followers” for the first time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>About that same time some prophets went from Jerusalem to Antioch.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>One of them, named Agabus, stood up and spoke with the help of the Spirit. He said, “A very bad time is coming to the whole world. There will be no food for people to eat.” (This time of famine happened when Claudius was emperor.)  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The Lord’s followers decided that they would each send as much as they could to help their brothers and sisters who lived in Judea.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They gathered the money and gave it to Barnabas and Saul, who took it to the elders in Judea. </div><ul class='tnav'>
