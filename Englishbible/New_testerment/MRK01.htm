He told them to be baptized to show that they wanted to change their lives, and then their sins would be forgiven.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>All the people from Judea, including everyone from Jerusalem, came out to John. They confessed the bad things they had done, and he baptized them in the Jordan River. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>John wore clothes made from camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>This is what John told the people: “There is someone coming later who is able to do more than I can. I am not good enough to be the slave who stoops down to untie his sandals.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I baptize you with water, but the one who is coming will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Baptized by John </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 3:13-17; Luke 3:21-22) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>About that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to the place where John was. John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw the sky torn open. The Spirit came down on him like a dove.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>A voice came from heaven and said, “You are my Son, the one I love.

During this time he was out among the wild animals. Then angels came and helped him. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Begins His Work in Galilee </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 4:12-17; Luke 4:14-15) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee and told people the Good News from God.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He said, “The right time is now here. God’s kingdom is very near.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> is very near Or “is coming soon” or “has come.”</span></a> Change your hearts and lives, and believe the Good News!” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Chooses Some Followers </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 4:18-22; Luke 5:1-11) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus was walking by Lake Galilee. He saw Simon<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Simon Simon’s other name was Peter. Also in verses 29, 30, 36.</span></a> and his brother Andrew. These two men were fishermen, and they were throwing a net into the lake to catch fish.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “Come, follow me, and I will make you a different kind of fishermen. You will bring in people, not fish.”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So they immediately left their nets and followed Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus continued walking by Lake Galilee. He saw two more brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in their boat, preparing their nets to catch fish.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Their father Zebedee and the men who worked for him were in the boat with the brothers. When Jesus saw the brothers, he told them to come. They left their father and followed Jesus. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Frees a Man From an Evil Spirit </div><div class='r'>(Luke 4:31-37) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum. On the Sabbath day, Jesus went into the synagogue and taught the people.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They were amazed at his teaching. He did not teach like their teachers of the law. He taught like someone with authority.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>While Jesus was in the synagogue, a man was there who had an evil spirit inside him. The man shouted,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>“Jesus of Nazareth! What do you want with us? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are—God’s Holy One!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Jesus, his voice full of warning, said, “Be quiet, and come out of him!”  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The evil spirit made the man shake. Then the spirit made a loud noise and came out of him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The people were amazed. They asked each other, “What is happening here? This man is teaching something new, and he teaches with authority! He even commands evil spirits, and they obey him.”  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So the news about Jesus spread quickly everywhere in the area of Galilee. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many People </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jesus and the followers left the synagogue. They all went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Simon’s mother-in-law was very sick. She was in bed and had a fever. The people there told Jesus about her.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So he went to her bed. Jesus held her hand and helped her stand up. The fever left her, and she was healed. Then she began serving them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>That night, after the sun went down, the people brought to Jesus many who were sick. They also brought those who had demons inside them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Everyone in the town gathered at the door of that house.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus healed many of those who had different kinds of sicknesses. He also forced many demons out of people. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> who he was Meaning that the demons knew that Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of God.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Jesus Goes to Other Towns </div><div class='r'>(Luke 4:42-44) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The next morning Jesus woke up very early. He left the house while it was still dark and went to a place where he could be alone and pray.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Later, Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They found him and said, “Everyone is looking for you!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “We should go to another place. We can go to other towns around here, and I can tell God’s message to those people too. That is why I came.”  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>So Jesus traveled everywhere in Galilee. He spoke in the synagogues, and he forced demons out of people. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Sick Man </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>A man who had leprosy came to Jesus. The man bowed on his knees and begged him, “You have the power to heal me if you want.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>These last words made Jesus angry.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> These … angry Most Greek copies have “Moved with pity ….” But it is hard to explain why some good Greek copies and Latin versions have “Filled with anger …,” so many scholars now consider it to be the original reading.</span></a> But he touched him and said, “I want to heal you. Be healed!”  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Immediately the leprosy disappeared, and the man was healed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Jesus told the man to go, but he gave him a strong warning:  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>“Don’t tell anyone about what I did for you. But go and let the priest look at you.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> let the priest look at you The Law of Moses said a priest must decide when a person with leprosy was well.</span></a> And offer a gift to God because you have been healed.

So the news about Jesus spread. And that is why he could not enter a town if people saw him. He stayed in places where people did not live. But people came from all the towns to the places where he was. </div><ul class='tnav'>
