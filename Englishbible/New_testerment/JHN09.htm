<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>While Jesus was walking, he saw a man who had been blind since the time he was born.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jesus’ followers asked him, “Teacher, why was this man born blind? Whose sin made it happen? Was it his own sin or that of his parents?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “It was not any sin of this man or his parents that caused him to be blind. He was born blind so that he could be used to show what great things God can do.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>While it is daytime, we must continue doing the work of the one who sent me. The night is coming, and no one can work at night.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>After Jesus said this, he spit on the dirt, made some mud and put it on the man’s eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus told him, “Go and wash in Siloam pool.” (Siloam means “Sent.”) So the man went to the pool, washed and came back. He was now able to see. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>His neighbors and some others who had seen him begging said, “Look! Is this the same man who always sits and begs?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Some people said, “Yes! He is the one.” But others said, “No, he can’t be the same man. He only looks like him.” </div><div class='p'>So the man himself said, “I am that same man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They asked, “What happened? How did you get your sight?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went there and washed. And then I could see.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They asked him, “Where is this man?” </div><div class='p'>He answered, “I don’t know.” </div><div class='s'>Some Pharisees Have Questions </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then the people brought the man to the Pharisees.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The day Jesus had made mud and healed the man’s eyes was a Sabbath day.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you get your sight?” </div><div class='p'>He answered, “He put mud on my eyes. I washed, and now I can see.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Some of the Pharisees said, “That man does not obey the law about the Sabbath day. So he is not from God.” </div><div class='p'>Others said, “But someone who is a sinner cannot do these miraculous signs.” So they could not agree with each other. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They asked the man again, “Since it was your eyes he healed, what do you say about him?” </div><div class='p'>He answered, “He is a prophet.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man—that he was blind and was now healed. But later they sent for his parents.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They asked them, “Is this your son? You say he was born blind. So how can he see?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>His parents answered, “We know that this man is our son. And we know that he was born blind.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But we don’t know why he can see now. We don’t know who healed his eyes. Ask him. He is old enough to answer for himself.”  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. The leaders had already decided that they would punish anyone who said Jesus was the Messiah. They would stop them from coming to the synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>That is why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So the Jewish leaders called the man who had been blind. They told him to come in again. They said, “You should honor God by telling the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The man answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. But I do know this: I was blind, and now I can see.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They asked, “What did he do to you? How did he heal your eyes?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He answered, “I have already told you that. But you would not listen to me. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to be his followers too?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>At this they shouted insults at him and said, “You are his follower, not us! We are followers of Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>We know that God spoke to Moses. But we don’t even know where this man comes from!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The man answered, “This is really strange! You don’t know where he comes from, but he healed my eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>We all know that God does not listen to sinners, but he will listen to anyone who worships and obeys him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>This is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>This man must be from God. If he were not from God, he could not do anything like this.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The Jewish leaders answered, “You were born full of sin! Are you trying to teach us?” And they told the man to get out of the synagogue and to stay out. </div><div class='s'>Spiritual Blindness </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>When Jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave, he found him and asked him, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The man said, “Tell me who he is, sir, so I can believe in him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, “You have already seen him. The Son of Man is the one talking with you now.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>The man answered, “Yes, I believe, Lord!” Then he bowed and worshiped Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Jesus said, “I came into this world so that the world could be judged. I came so that people who are blind<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> people who are blind Jesus is talking about people who are spiritually blind (without understanding), not physically blind.</span></a> could see. And I came so that people who think they see would become blind.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Some of the Pharisees were near Jesus. They heard him say this. They asked, “What? Are you saying that we are blind too?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jesus said, “If you were really blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But you say that you see, so you are still guilty.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
