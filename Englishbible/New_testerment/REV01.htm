And Christ sent his angel to show it to his servant John,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>who has told everything he saw.

We are together in Jesus, and we share these things: suffering, the kingdom, and patient endurance. I was on the island of Patmos<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Patmos A small island in the Aegean Sea, near the coast of modern Turkey.</span></a> because I was faithful to God’s message and to the truth of Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>On the Lord’s Day, the Spirit took control of me. I heard a loud voice behind me that sounded like a trumpet.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>It said, “Write down in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I turned to see who was talking to me. When I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I saw someone among the lampstands who looked like the Son of Man. He was dressed in a long robe, with a golden sash tied around his chest.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>His head and hair were white like wool—wool that is white as snow. His eyes were like flames of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>His feet were like brass that glows hot in a furnace. His voice was like the noise of flooding water.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He held seven stars in his right hand. A sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth. He looked like the sun shining at its brightest time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. He put his right hand on me and said, “Don’t be afraid! I am the First and the Last.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I am the one who lives. I was dead, but look, I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So write what you see. Write the things that happen now and the things that will happen later.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Here is the hidden meaning of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands that you saw: The seven lampstands are the seven churches.
