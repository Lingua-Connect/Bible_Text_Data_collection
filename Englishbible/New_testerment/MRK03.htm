<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man on the Sabbath Day </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Another time Jesus went into the synagogue. In the synagogue there was a man with a crippled hand.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Some Jews there were watching Jesus closely. They were waiting to see if he would heal the man on a Sabbath day. They wanted to see Jesus do something wrong so that they could accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand, “Stand up here so that everyone can see you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then Jesus asked the people, “Which is the right thing to do on the Sabbath day: to do good or to do evil? Is it right to save a life or to destroy one?” The people said nothing to answer him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jesus looked at the people. He was angry, but he felt very sad because they were so stubborn. He said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held out his hand, and it was healed.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then the Pharisees left and made plans with the Herodians about a way to kill Jesus. </div><div class='s'>Many Follow Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus went away with his followers to the lake. A large crowd of people from Galilee followed them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Many also came from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Idumea, from the area across the Jordan River, and from the area around Tyre and Sidon. These people came because they heard about all that Jesus was doing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jesus saw how many people there were, so he told his followers to get a small boat and make it ready for him. He wanted the boat so that the crowds of people could not push against him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He had healed many of them, so all the sick people were pushing toward him to touch him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Some people had evil spirits inside them. When the evil spirits saw Jesus, they bowed before him and shouted, “You are the Son of God!”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Jesus gave the spirits a strong warning not to tell anyone who he was. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Chooses His Twelve Apostles </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 10:1-4; Luke 6:12-16) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Jesus went up on a hill and invited those he wanted to go with him. So they joined him there.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he chose twelve men and called them apostles. He wanted these twelve men to be with him, and he wanted to send them to other places to tell people God’s message.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He also wanted them to have the power to force demons out of people.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>These are the names of the twelve men Jesus chose: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'>Simon (the one Jesus named Peter), </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee (the ones Jesus named Boanerges, which means “Sons of Thunder”), </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Andrew, </div><div class='li'>Philip, </div><div class='li'>Bartholomew, </div><div class='li'>Matthew, </div><div class='li'>Thomas, </div><div class='li'>James, the son of Alphaeus, </div><div class='li'>Thaddaeus, </div><div class='li'>Simon, the Zealot, </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Judas Iscariot (the one who handed Jesus over to his enemies). </div><div class='s'>Jesus’ Power Is From God </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 12:22-32; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Jesus went home, but again a large crowd gathered there. There were so many people that he and his followers could not eat.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>His family heard about all these things. They went to get him because people said he was crazy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the teachers of the law from Jerusalem said, “Satan<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Satan Literally, “Beelzebul” (the devil).</span></a> is living inside him! He uses power from the ruler of demons to force demons out of people.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So Jesus called them together and talked to them using some stories. He said, “Satan will not force his own demons out of people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A kingdom that fights against itself will not survive.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And a family that is divided will not survive.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If Satan is against himself and is fighting against his own people, he will not survive. That would be the end of Satan. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>“Whoever wants to enter a strong man’s house and steal his things must first tie him up. Then they can steal the things from his house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“I want you to know that people can be forgiven for all the sinful things they do. They can even be forgiven for the bad things they say against God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. They will always be guilty of that sin.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Jesus said this because the teachers of the law had accused him of having an evil spirit inside him. </div><div class='s'>Jesus’ Followers Are His True Family </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 12:46-50; Luke 8:19-21) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came. They stood outside and sent someone in to tell him to come out.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Many people were sitting around Jesus. They said to him, “Your mother and brothers are waiting for you outside.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jesus asked, “Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then he looked at the people sitting around him and said, “These people are my mother and my brothers!  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what God wants.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
