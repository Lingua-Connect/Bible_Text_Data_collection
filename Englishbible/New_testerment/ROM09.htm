<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='s'>God and the Jewish People </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I am in Christ and I am telling you the truth. I am not lying. And my conscience, ruled by the Holy Spirit, agrees that what I say now is true.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>for my own people. They are my brothers and sisters, my earthly family. I wish I could help them. I would even have a curse on me and cut myself off from Christ if that would help them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They are the people of Israel, God’s chosen children. They have the glory of God and the agreements he made between himself and his people. God gave them the Law of Moses, the Temple worship, and his promises.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They are the descendants of our great fathers, and they are the earthly family of the Messiah, who is God over all things. Praise him forever!<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Messiah, who is … forever! Or “Messiah. May God, who rules over all things, be praised forever!”</span></a> Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I don’t mean that God failed to keep his promise to the Jewish people. But only some of the people of Israel are really God’s people.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> God’s people Literally, “Israel,” the people God chose to bring his blessings to the world.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And only some of Abraham’s descendants are true children of Abraham. This is what God said to Abraham: “Your true descendants will be those who come through Isaac.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Genesis 21:12.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This means that not all of Abraham’s descendants are God’s true children. Abraham’s true children are those who become God’s children because of the promise he made to Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Here is what God said in that promise: “About this time next year I will come back, and Sarah will have a son.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Genesis 18:10, 14.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And that is not all. Rebecca also had sons, and they had the same father. He is our father Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11-12&#160;</span>But before the two sons were born, God told Rebecca, “The older son will serve the younger.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Genesis 25:23.</span></a> This was before the boys had done anything good or bad. God said this before they were born so that the boy he wanted would be chosen because of God’s own plan. He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call, not because of anything the boys did.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As the Scriptures say, “I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.”<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Malachi 1:2-3.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So what does this mean? That God is not fair? We cannot say that.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>God said to Moses, “I will show mercy to anyone I want to show mercy to. I will show pity to anyone I choose.”<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Exodus 33:19.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So God will choose anyone he decides to show mercy to, and his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In the Scriptures God says to Pharaoh: “I made you king so that you could do this for me. I wanted to show my power through you. I wanted my name to be announced throughout the world.”<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Exodus 9:16.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So God shows mercy to those he wants to show mercy to and makes stubborn those he wants to make stubborn. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So one of you will ask me, “If God controls what we do, why does he blame us for our sins?”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Don’t ask that. You are only human and have no right to question God. A clay jar does not question the one who made it. It does not say, “Why did you make me like this?”  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The one who makes the jar can make anything he wants. He uses the same clay to make different things. He might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>It is the same way with what God has done. He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power. But he patiently endured those he was angry with—people who were ready to be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He waited with patience so that he could make known the riches of his glory to the people he has chosen to receive his mercy. God has already prepared them to share his glory.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>We are those people, the ones God chose not only from the Jews but also from those who are not Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>As the Scriptures say in the book of Hosea, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“The people who are not mine— </div><div class='q2'>I will say they are my people. </div><div class='q'>And the people I did not love— </div><div class='q2'>I will say they are the people I love.” <span class='rq'><a href='HOS02.htm#V23'>Hosea 2:23</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Where God said in the past, </div><div class='q2'>‘You are not my people’— </div><div class='q2'>there they will be called children of the living God.” <span class='rq'><a href='HOS01.htm#V10'>Hosea 1:10</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Isaiah cries out about Israel: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“There are so many people of Israel, </div><div class='q2'>they are like the grains of sand by the sea. </div><div class='q'>But only a few of them will be saved. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Yes, the Lord will quickly finish judging the people on the earth.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA10.htm#V22'>Isaiah 10:22-23</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>It is just as Isaiah said: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“The Lord All-Powerful </div><div class='q2'>allowed some of our people to live. </div><div class='q'>If he had not done that, </div><div class='q2'>we would now be like Sodom, </div><div class='q2'>and we would be like Gomorrah.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA01.htm#V9'>Isaiah 1:9</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So what does all this mean? It means that people who are not Jews were made right with God because of their faith, even though they were not trying to make themselves right.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the people of Israel, who tried to make themselves right with God by following the law, did not succeed.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They failed because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did. They did not trust in God to make them right. They fell over the stone that makes people fall.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The Scriptures talk about that stone: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Look, I put in Zion a stone that will make people stumble. </div><div class='q2'>It is a rock that will make people fall. </div><div class='q'>But anyone who trusts in him </div><div class='q2'>will never be disappointed.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA08.htm#V14'>Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href='ISA28.htm#V16'>28:16</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
