<div class='mt'>Colossians  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Greetings from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. I am an apostle because that is what God wanted. Greetings also from Timothy, our brother in Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ who live in Colossae. </div><div class='p'>Grace and peace to you from God our Father. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>In our prayers we always thank God for you. He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>We thank him because we have heard about the faith you have in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all of God’s people.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Your faith and love continue because you know what is waiting for you in heaven—the hope you have had since you first heard the true message, the Good News  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>that was told to you. Throughout the world, this Good News is bringing blessings and is spreading. And that’s what has been happening among you since the first time you heard it and understood the truth about God’s grace.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You heard it from Epaphras, our dear friend and co-worker. He is a faithful servant of Christ for us.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> us Many ancient Greek copies have “you.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He also told us about the love you have from the Spirit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Since the day we heard these things about you, we have continued praying for you. This is what we pray: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='mi'>that God will make you completely sure of what he wants by giving you all the wisdom and spiritual understanding you need;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>that this will help you live in a way that brings honor to the Lord and pleases him in every way; that your life will produce good works of every kind and that you will grow in your knowledge of God<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> that your life … God Or “that your knowledge of God will produce more and more good works of every kind in your life.”</span></a>;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>that God will strengthen you with his own great power, so that you will be patient and not give up when troubles come. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'>Then you will be happy  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and give thanks to the Father. He has made you able to have what he has promised to give all his holy people, who live in the light.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>God made us free from the power of darkness. And he brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Son paid the price to make us free. In him we have forgiveness of our sins. </div><div class='s'>The Son of God Is the Same as God </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>No one can see God, </div><div class='q2'>but the Son is exactly like God. </div><div class='q2'>He rules over everything that has been made.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> He … made Literally, “<span class='add'>He is the</span> firstborn of all creation.” See “firstborn” in the Word List.</span></a> </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Through his power all things were made: </div><div class='q2'>things in heaven and on earth, seen and not seen— </div><div class='q'>all spiritual rulers, lords, powers, and authorities. </div><div class='q2'>Everything was made through him and for him. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Son was there before anything was made. </div><div class='q2'>And all things continue because of him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He is the head of the body, which is the church. </div><div class='q2'>He is the beginning of everything else. </div><div class='q'>And he is the first among all who will be raised from death.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> first … death Literally, “firstborn from the dead.”</span></a> </div><div class='q2'>So in everything he is most important. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God was pleased for all of himself to live in the Son. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And through him, God was happy to bring all things back to himself again— </div><div class='q2'>things on earth and things in heaven. </div><div class='q'>God made peace by using the blood sacrifice of his Son on the cross. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>At one time you were separated from God. You were his enemies in your minds, because the evil you did was against him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But now he has made you his friends again. He did this by the death Christ suffered while he was in his body. He did it so that he could present you to himself as people who are holy, blameless, and without anything that would make you guilty before him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And that is what will happen if you continue to believe in the Good News you heard. You must remain strong and sure in your faith. You must not let anything cause you to give up the hope that became yours when you heard the Good News. That same Good News has been told to everyone on earth, and that’s the work that I, Paul, was given to do. </div><div class='s'>Paul’s Work for the Church </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I am happy in my sufferings for you. There is much that Christ must still suffer. And I gladly accept my part of those sufferings in my body for the good of his body, the church.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I became a servant of the church because God gave me a special work to do. This work helps you. My work is to tell the complete message of God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>This message is the secret truth that was hidden since the beginning of time. It was hidden from everyone for ages, but now it has been made known to God’s holy people.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>God decided to let his people know just how rich and glorious that truth is. That secret truth, which is for all people, is that Christ lives in you, his people. He is our hope for glory.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So we continue to tell people about Christ. We use all wisdom to counsel every person and teach every person. We are trying to bring everyone before God as people who have grown to be spiritually mature in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>To do this, I work and struggle using the great strength that Christ gives me. That strength is working in my life. </div><ul class='tnav'>
