Save up as much as you can from what you are blessed with. Then you will not have to gather it all after I come.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When I arrive, I will send some men to take your gift to Jerusalem. These will be the ones you all agree should go. I will send them with letters of introduction.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If it seems good for me to go too, we can all travel together. </div><div class='s'>Paul’s Plans </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I plan to go through Macedonia, so I will come to you after that.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Maybe I will stay with you for a time. I might even stay all winter. Then you can help me on my trip, wherever I go.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I don’t want to come see you now, because I would have to leave to go to other places. I hope to stay a longer time with you, if the Lord allows it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will stay here, because a good opportunity for a great and growing work has been given to me now. And there are many people working against it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Timothy might come to you. Try to make him feel comfortable with you. He is working for the Lord the same as I am.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So none of you should refuse to accept Timothy. Help him continue on his trip in peace so that he can come back to me. I am expecting him to come back with the other brothers. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers. He prefers not to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity. </div><div class='s'>Paul Ends His Letter </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Be careful. Hold firmly to your faith.

They have given themselves to the service of God’s people. I ask you, brothers and sisters,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>to follow the leading of people like these and others who work hard and serve together with them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I am happy that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have come. You are not here, but they have filled your place.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They have been a great encouragement to me and to you as well. You should recognize the value of such people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The churches in Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you in the Lord. Also the church that meets in their house sends greetings.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>All the brothers and sisters here send their greetings.
