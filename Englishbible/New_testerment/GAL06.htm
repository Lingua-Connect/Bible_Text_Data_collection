You who are following the Spirit should go to the one who is sinning. Help make that person right again, and do it in a gentle way. But be careful, because you might be tempted to sin too.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Help each other with your troubles. When you do this, you are obeying the law of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If you think you are too important to do this, you are only fooling yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Don’t compare yourself with others. Just look at your own work to see if you have done anything to be proud of.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You must each accept the responsibilities that are yours. </div><div class='s'>Never Stop Doing Good </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Whoever is being taught God’s word should share the good things they have with the one who is teaching them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If you think you can fool God, you are only fooling yourselves. You will harvest what you plant.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If you live to satisfy your sinful self, the harvest you will get from that will be eternal death. But if you live to please the Spirit, your harvest from the Spirit will be eternal life.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>We must not get tired of doing good. We will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time. We must not give up.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When we have the opportunity to do good to anyone, we should do it. But we should give special attention to those who are in the family of believers. </div><div class='s'>Paul Ends His Letter </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This is my own handwriting. You can see how big the letters are.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Those men who are trying to force you to be circumcised are only doing it so that their people will accept them. They are afraid they will be persecuted if they follow only the cross<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> cross Paul uses the cross as a picture of the Good News, the story of Christ’s death to pay for people’s sins.
