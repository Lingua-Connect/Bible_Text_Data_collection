<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div><div class='s'>People in Heaven Praise God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After this I heard what sounded like a large crowd of people in heaven. The people were saying, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Hallelujah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Hallelujah This means “Praise God!” Also in verses 3, 4, 6.</span></a>! </div><div class='q'>Victory, glory, and power belong to our God. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>His judgments are true and right. </div><div class='q'>Our God has punished the prostitute. </div><div class='q2'>She is the one who ruined the earth with her sexual sin. </div><div class='q'>God has punished the prostitute to pay her back for the death of his servants.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>These people also said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Hallelujah! </div><div class='q2'>She is burning and her smoke will rise forever and ever.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the 24 elders and the four living beings bowed down. They worshiped God, who sits on the throne. They said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Amen! Hallelujah!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then a voice came from the throne and said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Praise our God, </div><div class='q2'>all you who serve him! </div><div class='q'>Praise our God, </div><div class='q2'>all you small and great who honor him!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then I heard something that sounded like a large crowd of people. It was as loud as crashing waves or claps of thunder. The people were saying, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Hallelujah! </div><div class='q2'>Our Lord God rules. </div><div class='q2'>He is the All-Powerful. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Let us rejoice and be happy </div><div class='q2'>and give God glory! </div><div class='q'>Give God glory, because the wedding of the Lamb has come. </div><div class='q2'>And the Lamb’s bride has made herself ready. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Fine linen was given to the bride for her to wear. </div><div class='q2'>The linen was bright and clean.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>(The fine linen means the good things that God’s holy people did.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the angel said to me, “Write this: Great blessings belong to those who are invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb!” Then the angel said, “These are the true words of God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then I bowed down before the angel’s feet to worship him. But the angel said to me, “Don’t worship me! I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the truth of Jesus. So worship God! Because the truth of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” </div><div class='s'>The Rider on the White Horse </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then I saw heaven open. There before me was a white horse. The rider on the horse was called Faithful and True, because he is right in his judging and in making war.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His eyes were like burning fire. He had many crowns on his head. A name was written on him, but he was the only one who knew its meaning.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He was dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and he was called the Word of God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The armies of heaven were following the rider on the white horse. They were also riding white horses. They were dressed in fine linen, white and clean.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>A sharp sword came out of the rider’s mouth, a sword that he would use to defeat the nations. And he will rule the nations with a rod of iron. He will crush the grapes in the winepress of the terrible anger of God All-Powerful.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>On his robe and on his leg was written this name: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='pc'><span class='sc'>king of kings and lord of lords</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun. In a loud voice the angel said to all the birds flying in the sky, “Come together for the great supper of God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Come together so that you can eat the bodies of rulers and army commanders and famous men. Come to eat the bodies of the horses and their riders and the bodies of all people—free, slave, small, and great.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then I saw the beast and the rulers of the earth. Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the beast was captured, and the false prophet was also captured. He was the one who did the miracles<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> miracles False miracles—amazing acts done by the power of the devil.</span></a> for the beast. He had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its idol. The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse. All the birds ate these bodies until they were full. </div><ul class='tnav'>
