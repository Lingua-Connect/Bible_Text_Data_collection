<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='s'>Paul and Silas in Thessalonica </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul and Silas traveled through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia. They came to the city of Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Paul went into the synagogue to see the Jews as he always did. The next three weeks, on each Sabbath day, he discussed the Scriptures with them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He explained the Scriptures to show them that the Messiah had to die and then rise from death. He said, “This Jesus that I am telling you about is the Messiah.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Some of the Jews there believed Paul and Silas and decided to join them. Also, a large number of Greeks who were worshipers of the true God and many important women joined them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But the Jews who did not believe became jealous, so they got some bad men from around the city center to make trouble. They formed a mob and caused a riot in the city. They went to Jason’s house, looking for Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them out before the people.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the other believers to the city leaders. The people shouted, “These men have made trouble everywhere in the world, and now they have come here too!  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jason is keeping them in his house. They all do things against the laws of Caesar. They say there is another king called Jesus.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When the city leaders and the other people heard this, they became very upset.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They made Jason and the other believers deposit money to guarantee that there would be no more trouble. Then they let them go. </div><div class='s'>Paul and Silas Go to Berea </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>That same night the believers sent Paul and Silas to another city named Berea. When they arrived there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The people in Berea were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica. They were so glad to hear the message Paul told them. They studied the Scriptures every day to make sure that what they heard was really true.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The result was that many of them believed, including many important Greek women and men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was telling people God’s message in Berea, they came there too. They upset the people and made trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the believers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Those who went with Paul took him to the city of Athens. They returned with a message for Silas and Timothy to come and join him as soon as they could. </div><div class='s'>Paul in Athens </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>While Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy in Athens, he was upset because he saw that the city was full of idols.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In the synagogue he talked with the Jews and with the Greeks who were worshipers of the true God. He also went to the public square every day and talked with everyone who came by.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Some of the Epicurean and some of the Stoic philosophers argued with him. </div><div class='p'>Some of them said, “This man doesn’t really know what he is talking about. What is he trying to say?” Paul was telling them the Good News about Jesus and the resurrection. So they said, “He seems to be telling us about some other gods.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They took Paul to a meeting of the Areopagus council. They said, “Please explain to us this new idea that you have been teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The things you are saying are new to us. We have never heard this teaching before, and we want to know what it means.”  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>(The people of Athens and the foreigners who lived there spent all their time either telling or listening to all the latest ideas.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Paul stood up before the meeting of the Areopagus council and said, “Men of Athens, everything I see here tells me you are very religious.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I was going through your city and I saw the things you worship. I found an altar that had these words written on it: ‘<span class='sc'>to an unknown god</span>.’ You worship a god that you don’t know. This is the God I want to tell you about. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>“He is the God who made the whole world and everything in it. He is the Lord of the land and the sky. He does not live in temples built by human hands.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He is the one who gives people life, breath, and everything else they need. He does not need any help from them. He has everything he needs.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>God began by making one man, and from him he made all the different people who live everywhere in the world. He decided exactly when and where they would live. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>“God wanted people to look for him, and perhaps in searching all around for him, they would find him. But he is not far from any of us.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>It is through him that we are able to live, to do what we do, and to be who we are. As your own poets have said, ‘We all come from him.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>“That’s right. We all come from God. So you must not think that he is like something people imagine or make. He is not made of gold, silver, or stone.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>In the past people did not understand God, and he overlooked this. But now he is telling everyone in the world to change and turn to him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He has decided on a day when he will judge all the people in the world in a way that is fair. To do this he will use a man he chose long ago. And he has proved to everyone that this is the man to do it. He proved it by raising him from death!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>When the people heard about Jesus being raised from death, some of them laughed. But others said, “We will hear more about this from you later.”  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So Paul left the council meeting.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But some of the people joined with Paul and became believers. Among these were Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus council, a woman named Damaris, and some others. </div><ul class='tnav'>
