You bring me joy and make me proud of you. Continue following the Lord as I have told you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Euodia and Syntyche, you both belong to the Lord, so please agree with each other.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For this I make a special request to my friend who has served with me so faithfully: Help these women. They worked hard with me in telling people the Good News, together with Clement and others who worked with me. Their names are written in the book of life.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> book of life God’s book that contains the names of his chosen people. See Rev. 3:5; 21:27.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Always be filled with joy in the Lord. I will say it again. Be filled with joy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Let everyone see that you are gentle and kind. The Lord is coming soon.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Don’t worry about anything, but pray and ask God for everything you need, always giving thanks for what you have.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And because you belong to Christ Jesus, God’s peace will stand guard over all your thoughts and feelings. His peace can do this far better than our human minds.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> can do … minds Literally, “surpasses (is better than) every mind,” which could also have the meaning “is beyond all understanding.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Brothers and sisters, continue to think about what is good and worthy of praise. Think about what is true and honorable and right and pure and beautiful and respected.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And do what you learned and received from me—what I told you and what you saw me do. And the God who gives peace will be with you. </div><div class='s'>Paul Thanks the Philippian Believers </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I am so happy, and I thank the Lord that you have again shown your care for me. You continued to care about me, but there was no way for you to show it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I am telling you this, but not because I need something. I have learned to be satisfied with what I have and with whatever happens.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I know how to live when I am poor and when I have plenty. I have learned the secret of how to live through any kind of situation—when I have enough to eat or when I am hungry, when I have everything I need or when I have nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Christ is the one who gives me the strength I need to do whatever I must do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But it was good that you helped me when I needed help.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You people in Philippi remember when I first told the Good News there. When I left Macedonia, you were the only church that gave me help.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Several times you sent me things I needed when I was in Thessalonica.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Really, it is not that I want to get gifts from you. But I want you to have the benefit that comes from giving.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I have everything I need. I have even more than I need. I have all I need because Epaphroditus brought your gift to me. Your gift is like a sweet-smelling sacrifice offered to God. God accepts that sacrifice and it pleases him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My God will use his glorious riches to give you everything you need. He will do this through Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Glory to our God and Father forever and ever. Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Give our greetings to God’s people there—to each one who belongs to Christ Jesus. Those in God’s family who are with me send you their greetings.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And greetings to you from all of God’s people here, especially those who work in the service of the emperor. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. </div><ul class='tnav'>
