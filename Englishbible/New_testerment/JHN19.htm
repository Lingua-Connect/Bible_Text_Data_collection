<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be taken away and whipped.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The soldiers made a crown from thorny branches and put it on his head. Then they put a purple robe around him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They kept coming up to him and saying, “Hail to the king of the Jews!” And they hit him in the face. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Again Pilate came out and said to the Jewish leaders, “Look! I am bringing Jesus out to you. I want you to know that I find nothing I can charge him with.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is the man!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When the leading priests and the Jewish guards saw Jesus they shouted, “Kill him on a cross! Kill him on a cross!” </div><div class='p'>But Pilate answered, “You take him and nail him to a cross yourselves. I find nothing I can charge him with.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Jewish leaders answered, “We have a law that says he must die, because he said he is the Son of God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When Pilate heard this, he was more afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So he went back inside the palace and asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not answer him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Pilate said, “You refuse to speak to me? Remember, I have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God. So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>After this, Pilate tried to let Jesus go free. But the Jewish leaders shouted, “Anyone who makes himself a king is against Caesar. So if you let this man go free, that means you are not Caesar’s friend.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out to the place called “The Stone Pavement.” (In Aramaic the name is <span class='tl'>Gabbatha.</span>) Pilate sat down on the judge’s seat there.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>It was now almost noon on Preparation day of Passover week. Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is your king!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Kill him on a cross!” </div><div class='p'>Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to kill your king on a cross?” </div><div class='p'>The leading priests answered, “The only king we have is Caesar!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be killed on a cross. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:32-44; Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-39) </div><div class='p'>The soldiers took Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He carried his own cross to a place called “The Place of the Skull.” (In Aramaic the name of this place is “Golgotha.”)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There they nailed Jesus to the cross. They also nailed two other men to crosses. They put them on each side of Jesus with him in the middle. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Pilate told them to write a sign and put it on the cross. The sign said, “<span class='sc'>jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews</span>.”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The sign was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross was near the city. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The leading Jewish priests said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews.’ But write, ‘This man said, I am the King of the Jews.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Pilate answered, “I will not change what I have written.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts. Each soldier got one part. They also took his tunic. It was all one piece of cloth woven from top to bottom.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So the soldiers said to each other, “We should not tear this into parts. Let’s throw lots to see who will get it.” This happened to make clear the full meaning of what the Scriptures say: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“They divided my clothes among them, </div><div class='q2'>and they threw lots for what I was wearing.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA022.htm#V18'>Psalm 22:18</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>So the soldiers did this. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Jesus’ mother stood near his cross. Her sister was also standing there with Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Jesus saw his mother. He also saw the follower he loved very much standing there. He said to his mother, “Dear woman, here is your son.”  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then he said to the follower, “Here is your mother.” So after that, this follower took Jesus’ mother to live in his home. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Dies </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:45-56; Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Later, Jesus knew that everything had been done. To make the Scriptures come true he said, “I am thirsty.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “I am thirsty” See Psalm 22:15; 69:21.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>There was a jar full of sour wine there, so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it. They put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus’ mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When he tasted the wine, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and died. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>This day was Preparation day. The next day was a special Sabbath day. The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day. So they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken. And they asked that the bodies be taken down from the crosses.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So the soldiers came and broke the legs<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> broke the legs The legs were broken to make those on the crosses die more quickly.</span></a> of the two men on the crosses beside Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But when the soldiers came close to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead. So they did not break his legs. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus’ side. Immediately blood and water came out.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>(The one who saw this happen has told about it. He told about it so that you also can believe. The things he says are true. He knows that he tells the truth.)  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>These things happened to give full meaning to the Scriptures that said, “None of his bones will be broken”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Quote from Psalm 34:20. The idea is from Exodus 12:46; Num. 9:12.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>and “People will look at the one they stabbed.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Zechariah 12:10.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Buried </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Later, a man named Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. (Joseph was a follower of Jesus, but he did not tell anyone, because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders.) Pilate said Joseph could take Jesus’ body, so he came and took it away. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Nicodemus went with Joseph. He was the man who had come to Jesus before and talked to him at night. He brought about 100 pounds<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 100 pounds Literally, “100 <span class='tl'>litras</span>” (Roman pounds), equal to 32.7 kg (72 pounds).</span></a> of spices—a mixture of myrrh and aloes.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>These two men took Jesus’ body and wrapped it in pieces of linen cloth with the spices. (This is how the Jews bury people.)  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>In the place where Jesus was killed on the cross, there was a garden. In the garden there was a new tomb. No one had ever been buried there before.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The men put Jesus in that tomb because it was near, and the Jews were preparing to start their Sabbath day. </div><ul class='tnav'>
