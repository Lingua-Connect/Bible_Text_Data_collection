Our great and glorious God appeared to Abraham, our ancestor, when he was in Mesopotamia. This was before he lived in Haran.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>God said to him, ‘Leave your country and your people, and go to the country I will show you.’<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Genesis 12:1.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“So Abraham left the country of Chaldea.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Chaldea Or “Babylonia,” a land in the southern part of Mesopotamia. See verse 2.</span></a> He went to live in Haran. After his father died, God sent him to this place, where you live now.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But God did not give Abraham any of this land, not even a foot of it. But God promised that in the future he would give Abraham this land for himself and for his children. This was before Abraham had any children. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“This is what God said to him: ‘Your descendants will live in another country. They will be strangers. The people there will make them slaves and mistreat them for 400 years.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But I will punish the nation that made them slaves.’<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Genesis 15:13-14.</span></a> And God also said, ‘After those things happen, your people will come out of that country. Then they will worship me here in this place.’<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Genesis 15:14; Exodus 3:12.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“God made an agreement with Abraham; the sign for this agreement was circumcision. And so when Abraham had a son, he circumcised him when he was eight days old. His son’s name was Isaac. Isaac also circumcised his son Jacob. And Jacob did the same for his sons, who became the twelve great ancestors of our people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“These ancestors of ours became jealous of their brother Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God was with him  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and saved him from all his troubles. Pharaoh was the king of Egypt then. He liked Joseph and respected him because of the wisdom God gave him. Pharaoh gave Joseph the job of being a governor of Egypt. He even let him rule over all the people in Pharaoh’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But all the land of Egypt and of Canaan became dry. It became so dry that food could not grow, and the people suffered very much. Our people could not find anything to eat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“But Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt. So he sent our people there. This was their first trip to Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then they went there a second time. This time Joseph told his brothers who he was. And Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Joseph sent some men to tell Jacob, his father, to come to Egypt. He also invited all his relatives, a total of 75 people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So Jacob went down to Egypt. He and our other ancestors lived there until they died.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Later, their bodies were moved to Shechem, where they were put in a tomb. It was the same tomb that Abraham had bought in Shechem from the sons of Hamor. He paid them with silver. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“The number of our people in Egypt grew. There were more and more of our people there. The promise that God made to Abraham was soon to come true.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then a different king began to rule Egypt, one who knew nothing about Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>This king tricked our people. He treated them badly, making them leave their children outside to die. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“This was the time when Moses was born. He was a very beautiful child, and for three months his parents took care of him at home.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>When they put him outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him. She raised him as her own son.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Egyptians taught Moses everything they knew. He was powerful in all he said and did. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“When Moses was about 40 years old, he decided to visit his own people, the people of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he defended him. Moses hit the Egyptian to pay him back for hurting the man. He hit him so hard that it killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Moses thought that his people would understand that God was using him to save them. But they did not understand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>“The next day, Moses saw two of his own people fighting. He tried to make peace between them. He said, ‘Men, you are brothers! Why are you trying to hurt each other?’  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The man who was hurting the other one pushed Moses away and said to him, ‘Did anyone say you could be our ruler and judge?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Will you kill me just as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?’<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Exodus 2:14.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When Moses heard him say this, he left Egypt. He went to live in the land of Midian, where he was a stranger. During the time he lived there, he had two sons. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>“Forty years later Moses was in the desert near Mount Sinai. An angel appeared to him in the flame of a burning bush.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>When Moses saw this, he was amazed. He went near to look closer at it. He heard a voice; it was the Lord’s.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The Lord said, ‘I am the same God your ancestors had—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Exodus 3:6.</span></a> Moses began to shake with fear. He was afraid to look at the bush. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>“The Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, because the place where you are now standing is holy ground.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>I have seen my people suffer much in Egypt. I have heard my people crying and have come down to save them. Come now, Moses, I am sending you back to Egypt.’<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Exodus 3:5-10.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>“This Moses was the one his people said they did not want. They said, ‘Did anyone say you could be our ruler and judge?’<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Exodus 2:14.</span></a> But he is the one God sent to be a ruler and savior. God sent him with the help of an angel, the one Moses saw in the burning bush.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So Moses led the people out of Egypt. He worked wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and then in the desert for 40 years. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>“This is the same Moses who said these words to the people of Israel: ‘God will give you a prophet. That prophet will come from among your own people. He will be like me.’<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deuteronomy 18:15.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>This same Moses was with the gathering of God’s people in the desert. He was with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and he was with our ancestors. He received life-giving words from God to give to us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>“But our ancestors did not want to obey Moses. They rejected him. They wanted to go back to Egypt again.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>They said to Aaron, ‘Moses led us out of the country of Egypt. But we don’t know what has happened to him. So make some gods to go before us and lead us.’<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Exodus 32:1.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>So the people made an idol that looked like a calf. Then they brought sacrifices to it. They were very happy with what they had made with their own hands.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But God turned against them and let them continue worshiping the army of false gods in the sky. This is what God says in the book that contains what the prophets wrote: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘People of Israel, you did not bring me blood offerings and sacrifices </div><div class='q2'>in the desert for 40 years; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>You carried with you the tent for worshiping Moloch </div><div class='q2'>and the image of the star of your god Rephan. </div><div class='q'>These were the idols you made to worship. </div><div class='q2'>So I will send you away beyond Babylon.’ <span class='rq'><a href='AMO05.htm#V25'>Amos 5:25-27</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>“The Holy Tent<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Holy Tent Literally, “Tent of the Testimony.” See “Holy Tent” in the Word List.</span></a> was with our ancestors in the desert. God told Moses how to make this tent. He made it like the plan that God showed him.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Later, Joshua led our ancestors to capture the lands of the other nations. Our people went in and God made the other people go out. When our people went into this new land, they took with them this same tent. Our people received this tent from their fathers, and our people kept it until the time of David.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>God was very pleased with David. He asked God to let him build a Temple for the people of Jacob.<a href="#FN12" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> for the people of Jacob Some Greek copies have “for the God of Jacob.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>But Solomon was the one who built the Temple. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>“But the Most High God does not live in houses built by human hands. This is what the prophet<a href="#FN13" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> prophet Isaiah, who spoke for God about 740-700 B.C.</span></a> writes: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>‘The Lord says, Heaven is my throne, </div><div class='q2'>and the earth is where I rest my feet. </div><div class='q'>So do you think you can build a house for me? </div><div class='q2'>Do I need a place to rest? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Remember, I made all these things!’ ” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA66.htm#V1'>Isaiah 66:1-2</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Then Stephen said, “You stubborn Jewish leaders! You refuse to give your hearts to God or even listen to him. You are always against what the Holy Spirit wants you to do. That’s how your ancestors were, and you are just like them!  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>They persecuted every prophet who ever lived. They even killed those who long ago said that the Righteous One would come. And now you have turned against that Righteous One and killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>You are the people who received God’s law, which he gave you through his angels. But you don’t obey it!” </div><div class='s'>Stephen Is Killed </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>When those in the council meeting heard this, they became very angry. They were so mad they were grinding their teeth at him.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>But Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit. He looked up into heaven and saw the glory of God. And he saw Jesus standing at God’s right side.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Stephen said, “Look! I see heaven open. And I see the Son of Man standing at God’s right side.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Everyone there started shouting loudly, covering their ears with their hands. Together they all ran at Stephen.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>They took him out of the city and began throwing stones at him. The men who told lies against Stephen gave their coats to a young man named Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>As they were throwing the stones at him, Stephen was praying. He said, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>He fell on his knees and shouted, “Lord, don’t blame them for this sin!” These were his last words before he died. </div><ul class='tnav'>
