<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='s'>God Will Answer His People </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Jesus taught the followers that they should always pray and never lose hope. He used this story to teach them:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Once there was a judge in a town. He did not care about God. He also did not care what people thought about him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>In that same town there was a woman whose husband had died. She came many times to this judge and said, ‘There is a man who is doing bad things to me. Give me my rights!’  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But the judge did not want to help the woman. After a long time, the judge thought to himself, ‘I don’t care about God. And I don’t care about what people think.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But this woman is bothering me. If I give her what she wants, then she will leave me alone. But if I don’t give her what she wants, she will bother me until I am sick.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The Lord said, “Listen, there is meaning in what the bad judge said.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>God’s people shout to him night and day, and he will always give them what is right. He will not be slow to answer them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I tell you, God will help his people quickly. But when the Son of Man comes again, will he find people on earth who believe in him?” </div><div class='s'>Being Right With God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There were some people who thought they were very good and looked down on everyone else. Jesus used this story to teach them:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“One time there was a Pharisee and a tax collector. One day they both went to the Temple to pray.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Pharisee stood alone, away from the tax collector. When the Pharisee prayed, he said, ‘O God, I thank you that I am not as bad as other people. I am not like men who steal, cheat, or commit adultery. I thank you that I am better than this tax collector.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I fast twice a week, and I give a tenth of everything I get!’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“The tax collector stood alone too. But when he prayed, he would not even look up to heaven. He felt very humble before God. He said, ‘O God, have mercy on me. I am a sinner!’  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I tell you, when this man finished his prayer and went home, he was right with God. But the Pharisee, who felt that he was better than others, was not right with God. People who make themselves important will be made humble. But those who make themselves humble will be made important.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Welcomes Children </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Some people brought their small children to Jesus so that he could lay his hands on them to bless them. But when the followers saw this, they told the people not to do this.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Jesus called the little children to him and said to his followers, “Let the little children come to me. Don’t stop them, because God’s kingdom belongs to people who are like these little children.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The truth is, you must accept God’s kingdom like a little child accepts things, or you will never enter it.” </div><div class='s'>A Rich Man Refuses to Follow Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 19:16-30; Mark 10:17-31) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A religious leader asked Jesus, “Good Teacher, what must I do to get eternal life?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? Only God is good.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And you know his commands: ‘You must not commit adultery, you must not murder anyone, you must not steal, you must not tell lies about others, you must respect your father and mother ….’<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20.</span></a>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the leader said, “I have obeyed all these commands since I was a boy.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When Jesus heard this, he said to the leader, “But there is still one thing you need to do. Sell everything you have and give the money to those who are poor. You will have riches in heaven. Then come and follow me.”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But when the man heard Jesus tell him to give away his money, he was sad. He didn’t want to do this, because he was very rich. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When Jesus saw that the man was sad, he said, “It will be very hard for rich people to enter God’s kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom.” </div><div class='s'>Who Can Be Saved? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When the people heard this, they said, “Then who can be saved?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “God can do things that are not possible for people to do.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Peter said, “Look, we left everything we had and followed you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jesus said, “I can promise that everyone who has left their home, wife, brothers, parents, or children for God’s kingdom  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>will get much more than they left. They will get many times more in this life. And in the world that is coming they will get the reward of eternal life.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Talks Again About His Death </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 20:17-19; Mark 10:32-34) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Jesus talked to the twelve apostles alone. He said to them, “Listen, we are going to Jerusalem. Everything that God told the prophets to write about the Son of Man will happen.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He will be handed over to the foreigners, who will laugh at him, insult him, and spit on him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They will beat him with whips and then kill him. But on the third day after his death, he will rise to life again.”  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The apostles tried to understand this, but they could not; the meaning was hidden from them. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Blind Man </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 20:29-34; Mark 10:46-52) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Jesus came near the city of Jericho. There was a blind man sitting beside the road. He was begging people for money.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>When he heard the people coming down the road, he asked, “What is happening?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They told him, “Jesus, the one from Nazareth, is coming here.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>The blind man was excited and said, “Jesus, Son of David, please help me!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The people who were in front leading the group criticized the blind man. They told him to be quiet. But he shouted more and more, “Son of David, please help me!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Jesus stopped there and said, “Bring that man to me!” When he came close, Jesus asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>“What do you want me to do for you?” </div><div class='p'>He said, “Lord, I want to see again.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, “You can see now. You are healed because you believed.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then the man was able to see. He followed Jesus, thanking God. Everyone who saw this praised God for what happened. </div><ul class='tnav'>
