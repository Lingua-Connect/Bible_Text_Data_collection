<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 28</div><div class='s'>Paul on the Island of Malta </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When we were safe on land, we learned that the island was called Malta.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The people who lived there were very good to us. It was raining and very cold, so they built a fire and welcomed all of us.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Paul gathered a pile of sticks for the fire. He was putting the sticks on the fire, and a poisonous snake came out because of the heat and bit him on the hand.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When the people living on the island saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said, “This man must be a murderer! He did not die in the sea, but Justice<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Justice The people thought there was a goddess named Justice who would punish bad people.</span></a> does not want him to live.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and was not hurt.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The people thought he would swell up or fall down dead. They waited and watched him for a long time, but nothing bad happened to him. So they changed their opinion. They said, “He is a god!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There were some fields around that same area. They were owned by a man named Publius, the most important Roman official on the island. He welcomed us into his home and was very good to us. We stayed in his house for three days.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Publius’ father was very sick. He had a fever and dysentery, but Paul went to him and prayed for him. He laid his hands on the man and healed him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>After this happened, all the other sick people on the island came to Paul, and he healed them too. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10-11&#160;</span>The people on the island gave us many honors. And after we had been there three months and were ready to leave, they provided us everything we needed for our trip. </div><div class='s'>Paul Goes to Rome </div><div class='p'>We got on a ship from Alexandria that had stayed on the island of Malta during the winter. On the front of the ship was the sign for the twin gods.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> twin gods Statues of Castor and Pollux, Greek gods.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>We stopped at the city of Syracuse. We stayed there three days and then left.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>We came to the city of Rhegium. The next day a wind began to blow from the southwest, so we were able to leave. A day later we came to the city of Puteoli.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>We found some believers there, who asked us to stay with them a week. Finally, we came to Rome.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The brothers and sisters in Rome heard about us and came out to meet us at the Market of Appius<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Market of Appius A town about 43 miles (69 km) from Rome.</span></a> and at the Three Inns.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Three Inns A town about 30 miles (48 km) from Rome.</span></a> When Paul saw these believers, he thanked God and felt encouraged. </div><div class='s'>Paul in Rome </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When we came to Rome, Paul was allowed to live alone. But a soldier stayed with him to guard him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Three days later Paul sent for some of the most important Jews. When they came together, he said, “My brothers, I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our fathers. But I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They asked me many questions, but they could not find any reason why I should be put to death. So they wanted to let me go free.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But the Jews there did not want that. So I had to ask to come to Rome to have my trial before Caesar. That doesn’t mean I am accusing my people of doing anything wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>That is why I wanted to see you and talk with you. I am bound with this chain because I believe in the hope of Israel.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Jews answered Paul, “We have received no letters from Judea about you. None of our Jewish brothers who have traveled from there brought news about you or told us anything bad about you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>We want to hear your ideas. We know that people everywhere are speaking against this new group.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Paul and the Jews chose a day for a meeting. On that day many more of these Jews met with Paul at his house. He spoke to them all day long, explaining God’s kingdom to them. He used the Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets to persuade them to believe in Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Some of the Jews believed what he said, but others did not believe.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They had an argument among themselves and were ready to leave. But Paul said one more thing to them: “The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet. He said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>‘Go to this people and tell them: </div><div class='q'>You will listen and you will hear, </div><div class='q2'>but you will not understand. </div><div class='q'>You will look and you will see, </div><div class='q2'>but you will not understand what you see. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Yes, the minds of these people are now closed. </div><div class='q2'>They have ears, but they don’t listen. </div><div class='q2'>They have eyes, but they refuse to see. </div><div class='q'>If their minds were not closed, </div><div class='q2'>they might see with their eyes; </div><div class='q2'>they might hear with their ears; </div><div class='q2'>they might understand with their minds. </div><div class='q'>Then they might turn back to me and be healed.’ <span class='rq'><a href='ISA06.htm#V9'>Isaiah 6:9-10</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“I want you Jews to know that God has sent his salvation to the non-Jewish people.

He welcomed all the people who came and visited him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He told them about God’s kingdom and taught them about the Lord Jesus Christ. He was very bold, and no one tried to stop him from speaking. </div><ul class='tnav'>
