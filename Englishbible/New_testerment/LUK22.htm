<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='s'>The Jewish Leaders Plan to Kill Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:1-5, 14-16; Mark 14:1-2, 10-11; John 11:45-53) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>It was almost time for the Jewish Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The leading priests and teachers of the law wanted to kill Jesus. But they were trying to find a quiet way to do it, because they were afraid of what the people would do. </div><div class='s'>Judas Agrees to Help Jesus’ Enemies </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:14-16; Mark 14:10-11) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>One of Jesus’ twelve apostles was named Judas Iscariot. Satan entered him,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and he went and talked with the leading priests and some of the soldiers who guarded the Temple. He talked to them about a way to hand Jesus over to them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The priests were very happy about this. They promised to give Judas money for doing this.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He agreed. Then he waited for the best time to hand him over to them. He wanted to do it when no one was around to see it. </div><div class='s'>The Passover Meal </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:17-25; Mark 14:12-21; John 13:21-30) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Day of Unleavened Bread<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Day of Unleavened Bread Same as Passover.</span></a> came. This was the day when the Jews always killed the lambs for the Passover.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jesus said to Peter and John, “Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare the meal?” </div><div class='p'>He said to them,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“When you go into the city, you will see a man carrying a jar of water. Follow him. He will go into a house.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks that you please show us the room where he and his followers can eat the Passover meal.’  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the owner will show you a large room upstairs that is ready for us. Prepare the meal there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So Peter and John left. Everything happened the way Jesus said. So they prepared the Passover meal. </div><div class='s'>The Lord’s Supper </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:26-30; Mark 14:22-26; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The time came for them to eat the Passover meal. Jesus and the apostles were together at the table.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “I wanted very much to eat this Passover meal with you before I die.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will never eat another Passover meal until it is given its full meaning in God’s kingdom.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Jesus took a cup of wine. He gave thanks to God for it and said, “Take this cup and give it to everyone here.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I will never drink wine again until God’s kingdom comes.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then he took some bread and thanked God for it. He broke off some pieces, gave them to the apostles and said, “This bread is my body that I am giving for you. Eat this to remember me.”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In the same way, after supper, Jesus took the cup of wine and said, “This wine represents the new agreement from God to his people. It will begin when my blood is poured out for you.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> A few Greek copies do not have Jesus’ words in the last part of verse 19 and all of verse 20.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Who Will Turn Against Jesus? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus said, “But here on this table is the hand of the one who will hand me over to my enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Son of Man will do what God has planned. But it will be very bad for the one who hands over the Son of Man to be killed.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then the apostles asked each other, “Which one of us would do that?” </div><div class='s'>Be Like a Servant </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Later, the apostles began to argue about which one of them was the most important.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Jesus said to them, “The kings of the world rule over their people, and those who have authority over others want to be called ‘the great providers for the people.’  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But you must not be like that. The one with the most authority among you should act as if he is the least important. The one who leads should be like one who serves.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Who is more important: the one serving or the one sitting at the table being served? Everyone thinks it’s the one being served, right? But I have been with you as the one who serves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“You men have stayed with me through many struggles.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So I give you authority to rule with me in the kingdom the Father has given me.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>You will eat and drink at my table in that kingdom. You will sit on thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. </div><div class='s'>Peter Will Be Tested and Fail </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:31-35; Mark 14:27-31; John 13:36-38) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>“Satan has asked to test you men like a farmer tests his wheat. O Simon, Simon,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Simon Simon’s other name was Peter.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I have prayed that you will not lose your faith! Help your brothers be stronger when you come back to me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, I am ready to go to jail with you. I will even die with you!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But Jesus said, “Peter, before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will say you don’t know me. You will say this three times.” </div><div class='s'>Be Ready for Trouble </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to the apostles, “Remember when I sent you out without money, a bag, or sandals? Did you need anything?” </div><div class='p'>The apostles said, “No.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “But now if you have money or a bag, carry that with you. If you don’t have a sword, sell your coat and buy one.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘He was considered a criminal.’ <span class='rq'><a href='ISA53.htm#V12'>Isaiah 53:12</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>This Scripture must happen. It was written about me, and it is happening now.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>The followers said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” </div><div class='p'>Jesus said to them, “That’s enough.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> “That’s enough” Or “Enough of that!” meaning “Don’t talk anymore about such things.”</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Jesus Prays Alone </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:36-46; Mark 14:32-42) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39-40&#160;</span>Jesus left the city and went to the Mount of Olives. His followers went with him. (He went there often.) He said to his followers, “Pray for strength against temptation.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then Jesus went about 50 steps away from them. He knelt down and prayed,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>“Father, if you are willing, please don’t make me drink from this cup.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> cup A symbol of suffering. Jesus used the idea of drinking from a cup to mean accepting the suffering he would face in the terrible events that were soon to come.</span></a> But do what you want, not what I want.”  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then an angel from heaven came to help him.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Jesus was full of pain; he struggled hard in prayer. Sweat dripped from his face like drops of blood falling to the ground.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Some Greek copies do not have verses 43 and 44.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>When he finished praying, he went to his followers. He found them asleep, worn out from their grieving.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray for strength against temptation.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Arrested </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:47-56; Mark 14:43-50; John 18:3-11) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>While Jesus was speaking, a crowd came up. It was led by Judas, one of the twelve apostles. He came over to Jesus to kiss him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you using the kiss of friendship to hand over the Son of Man to his enemies?”  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>The followers of Jesus were standing there too. They saw what was happening and said to Jesus, “Lord, should we use our swords?”  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And one of them did use his sword. He cut off the right ear of the servant of the high priest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Stop!” Then he touched the servant’s ear and healed him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Jesus spoke to the group that came to arrest him. They were the leading priests, the older Jewish leaders, and the Jewish soldiers. He said to them, “Why did you come out here with swords and clubs? Do you think I am a criminal?  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>I was with you every day in the Temple area. Why didn’t you try to arrest me there? But this is your time—the time when darkness rules.” </div><div class='s'>Peter Is Afraid to Say He Knows Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:57-58, 69-75; Mark 14:53-54, 66-72; John 18:12-18, 25-27) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>They arrested Jesus and took him away to the house of the high priest. Peter followed Jesus but stayed back at a distance.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>The soldiers started a fire in the middle of the yard and sat together. Peter sat with them.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>A servant girl saw him sitting there. She could see because of the light from the fire. She looked closely at Peter’s face. Then she said, “This man was also with Jesus.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>But Peter said this was not true. He said, “Lady, I don’t know him.”  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>A short time later, someone else saw Peter and said, “You are also one of them.” </div><div class='p'>But Peter said, “Man, I am not!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>About an hour later, another man said, “It’s true. I’m sure this man was with him, because he is from Galilee.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” </div><div class='p'>Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Then the Lord turned and looked into Peter’s eyes. And Peter remembered what the Lord had said, “Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will say three times that you don’t know me.”  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Then Peter went outside and cried bitterly. </div><div class='s'>The Guards Treat Jesus Badly </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:67-68; Mark 14:65) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>The men guarding Jesus made fun of him and beat him.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>They covered his eyes so that he could not see them. Then they hit him and said, “Be a prophet<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> prophet A prophet often knows things that are hidden to other people.</span></a> and tell us who hit you!”  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And they shouted all kinds of insults at him. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Before the Jewish Leaders </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 26:59-66; Mark 14:55-64; John 18:19-24) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>The next morning, the older leaders of the people, the leading priests, and the teachers of the law came together.
