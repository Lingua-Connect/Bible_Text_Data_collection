So we beg you: Don’t let the grace that you received from God be for nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I heard you at the right time, </div><div class='q2'>and I gave you help on the day of salvation.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA49.htm#V8'>Isaiah 49:8</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>I tell you that the “right time” is now. The “day of salvation” is now. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>We don’t want people to find anything wrong with our work. So we do nothing that will be a problem to others.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But in every way we show that we are servants of God. We never give up, even though we face troubles, difficulties, and problems of every kind.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>We are beaten and thrown into prison. People get upset at us and fight against us. We work hard, and sometimes we get no sleep or food.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We show that we are God’s servants by our pure lives, by our understanding, by our patience, and by our kindness. We show it by the Holy Spirit, by genuine love,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>by speaking the truth, and by depending on God’s power. This right way of living has prepared us to defend ourselves against every kind of attack. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Some people honor us, but others shame us. Some people say good things about us, but others say bad things. Some people say we are liars, but we speak the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>To some people we are not known, but we are well known. We seem to be dying, but look! We continue to live. We are punished, but we are not killed.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>We have much sadness, but we are always rejoicing. We are poor, but we are making many people rich in faith. We have nothing, but really we have everything. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>We have spoken freely to you people in Corinth. We have opened our hearts to you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Our feelings of love for you have not stopped. It is you who have stopped your feelings of love for us.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I speak to you as if you were my children. Do the same as we have done—open your hearts also. </div><div class='s'>We Are God’s Temple </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You are not the same as those who don’t believe.
