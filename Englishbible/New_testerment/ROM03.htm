<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So, do Jews have anything that others don’t have? Do they get any benefit from being circumcised?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Yes, the Jews have many benefits. The most important one is this: God trusted the Jews with his teachings.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>It is true that some Jews were not faithful to God. But will that stop God from doing what he promised?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>No, even if everyone else is a liar, God will always do what he says. As the Scriptures say about him, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“You will be proved right in what you say, </div><div class='q2'>and you will win when people accuse you.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA051.htm#V4'>Psalm 51:4</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When we do wrong, that shows more clearly that God is right. So can we say that God does wrong when he punishes us? (That’s the way some people think.)  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Of course not. If God could not punish us, how could he judge the world? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Someone might say, “When I lie, it really gives God glory, because my lie makes his truth easier to see. So why am I judged a sinner?”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>It would be the same to say, “We should do evil so that good will come.” Many people criticize us, saying that’s what we teach. They are wrong, and they should be condemned for saying that. </div><div class='s'>All People Are Guilty </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So are we Jews better than other people? No, we have already said that those who are Jews, as well as those who are not Jews, are the same. They are all guilty of sin.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As the Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“There is no one doing what is right, </div><div class='q2'>not even one. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is no one who understands. </div><div class='q2'>There is no one who is trying to be with God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They have all turned away from him, </div><div class='q2'>and now they are of no use to anyone. </div><div class='q'>There is no one who does good, </div><div class='q2'>not even one.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA014.htm#V1'>Psalm 14:1-3</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Their words come from mouths that are like open graves. </div><div class='q2'>They use their lying tongues to deceive others.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA005.htm#V9'>Psalm 5:9</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Their words are like the poison of snakes.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA140.htm#V3'>Psalm 140:3</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“Their mouths are full of cursing and angry words.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA010.htm#V7'>Psalm 10:7</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“They are always ready to kill someone. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Everywhere they go they cause trouble and ruin. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They don’t know how to live in peace.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA59.htm#V7'>Isaiah 59:7-8</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“They have no fear or respect for God.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA036.htm#V1'>Psalm 36:1</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>What the law says is for those who are under the law. It stops anyone from making excuses. And it brings the whole world under God’s judgment,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>because no one can be made right with God by following the law. The law only shows us our sin. </div><div class='s'>How God Makes People Right </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But God has a way to make people right, and it has nothing to do with the law. He has now shown us that new way, which the law and the prophets told us about.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>God makes people right through their faith in<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> their faith in Or “the faithfulness of.”</span></a> Jesus Christ. He does this for all who believe in Christ. Everyone is the same.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>All have sinned and are not good enough to share God’s divine greatness.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They are made right with God by his grace. This is a free gift. They are made right with God by being made free from sin through Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25-26&#160;</span>God gave Jesus as a way to forgive people’s sins through their faith in him. God can forgive them because the blood sacrifice of Jesus pays for their sins. God gave Jesus to show that he always does what is right and fair. He was right in the past when he was patient and did not punish people for their sins. And in our own time he still does what is right. God worked all this out in a way that allows him to judge people fairly and still make right any person who has faith in Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So do we have any reason to boast about ourselves? No reason at all. And why not? Because we are depending on the way of faith, not on what we have done in following the law.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I mean we are made right with God through faith, not through what we have done to follow the law. This is what we believe.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>God is not only the God of the Jews. He is also the God of those who are not Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>There is only one God. He will make Jews<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Jews Literally, “circumcision.”</span></a> right with him by their faith, and he will also make non-Jews<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> non-Jews Literally, “uncircumcision.”</span></a> right with him through their faith.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So do we destroy the law by following the way of faith? Not at all! In fact, faith causes us to be what the law actually wants. </div><ul class='tnav'>
