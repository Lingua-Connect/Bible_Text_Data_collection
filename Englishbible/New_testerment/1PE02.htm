Do this for the Lord. Obey the king, the highest authority.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And obey the leaders who are sent by the king. They are sent to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do good.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When you do good, you stop ignorant people from saying foolish things about you.
