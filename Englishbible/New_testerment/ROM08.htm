<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='s'>Life in the Spirit </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So now anyone who is in Christ Jesus is not judged guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>That is because in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit that brings life made you<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> you Some Greek copies have “me.” Also in the next sentence.</span></a> free. It made you free from the law that brings sin and death.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The law was without power because it was made weak by our sinful selves. But God did what the law could not do: He sent his own Son to earth with the same human life that everyone else uses for sin. God sent him to be an offering to pay for sin. So God used a human life to destroy sin.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He did this so that we could be right just as the law said we must be. Now we don’t live following our sinful selves. We live following the Spirit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>People who live following their sinful selves think only about what they want. But those who live following the Spirit are thinking about what the Spirit wants them to do.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If your thinking is controlled by your sinful self, there is spiritual death. But if your thinking is controlled by the Spirit, there is life and peace.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Why is this true? Because anyone whose thinking is controlled by their sinful self is against God. They refuse to obey God’s law. And really they are not able to obey it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Those who are ruled by their sinful selves cannot please God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But you are not ruled by your sinful selves. You are ruled by the Spirit, if that Spirit of God really lives in you. But whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Your body will always be dead because of sin. But if Christ is in you, then the Spirit gives you life, because Christ made you right with God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>God raised Jesus from death. And if God’s Spirit lives in you, he will also give life to your bodies that die. Yes, God is the one who raised Christ from death, and he will raise you to life through his Spirit living in you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So, my brothers and sisters, we must not be ruled by our sinful selves. We must not live the way our sinful selves want.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If you use your lives to do what your sinful selves want, you will die spiritually. But if you use the Spirit’s help to stop doing the wrong things you do with your body, you will have true life. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The true children of God are those who let God’s Spirit lead them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Spirit that we received is not a spirit that makes us slaves again and causes us to fear. The Spirit that we have makes us God’s chosen children. And with that Spirit we cry out, “<span class='tl'>Abba</span>,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Abba An Aramaic word that was used by Jewish children as a name for their fathers.</span></a> Father.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Spirit himself speaks to our spirits and makes us sure that we are God’s children.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If we are God’s children, we will get the blessings God has for his people. He will give us all that he has given Christ. But we must suffer like Christ suffered. Then we will be able to share his glory. </div><div class='s'>We Will Have Glory in the Future </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>We have sufferings now, but these are nothing compared to the great glory that will be given to us.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Everything that God made is waiting with excitement for the time when he will show the world who his children are. The whole world wants very much for that to happen.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Everything God made was allowed to become like something that cannot fulfill its purpose. That was not its choice, but God made it happen with this hope in view:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>That the creation would be made free from ruin—that everything God made would have the same freedom and glory that belong to God’s children. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>We know that everything God made has been waiting until now in pain like a woman ready to give birth to a child.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Not only the world, but we also have been waiting with pain inside us. We have the Spirit as the first part of God’s promise. So we are waiting for God to finish making us his own children. I mean we are waiting for our bodies to be made free.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>We were saved to have this hope. If we can see what we are waiting for, that is not really hope. People don’t hope for something they already have.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But we are hoping for something we don’t have yet, and we are waiting for it patiently. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Also, the Spirit helps us. We are very weak, but the Spirit helps us with our weakness. We don’t know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit himself speaks to God for us. He begs God for us, speaking to him with feelings too deep for words.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>God already knows our deepest thoughts. And he understands what the Spirit is saying, because the Spirit speaks for his people in the way that agrees with what God wants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>We know that in everything God works for the good of those who love him. These are the people God chose, because that was his plan.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>God knew them before he made the world. And he decided that they would be like his Son. Then Jesus would be the firstborn of many brothers and sisters.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>God planned for them to be like his Son. He chose them and made them right with him. And after he made them right, he gave them his glory. </div><div class='s'>God’s Love in Christ Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So what should we say about this? If God is for us, no one can stand against us. And God is with us.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He even let his own Son suffer for us. God gave his Son for all of us. So now with Jesus, God will surely give us all things.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Who can accuse the people God has chosen? No one! God is the one who makes them right.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Who can say that God’s people are guilty? No one! Christ Jesus died for us, but that is not all. He was also raised from death. And now he is at God’s right side, speaking to him for us.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Can anything separate us from Christ’s love? Can trouble or problems or persecution separate us from his love? If we have no food or clothes or face danger or even death, will that separate us from his love?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>As the Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“For you we are in danger of death all the time. </div><div class='q2'>People think we are worth no more than sheep to be killed.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA044.htm#V22'>Psalm 44:22</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But in all these troubles we have complete victory through God, who has shown his love for us.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38-39&#160;</span>Yes, I am sure that nothing can separate us from God’s love—not death, life, angels, or ruling spirits. I am sure that nothing now, nothing in the future, no powers, nothing above us or nothing below us—nothing in the whole created world—will ever be able to separate us from the love God has shown us in Christ Jesus our Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
