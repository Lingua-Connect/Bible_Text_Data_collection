Considering what he has done, it is only right that you should worship him in this way.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Don’t change yourselves to be like the people of this world, but let God change you inside with a new way of thinking. Then you will be able to understand and accept what God wants for you. You will be able to know what is good and pleasing to him and what is perfect. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>God has given me a special gift, and that is why I have something to say to each one of you. Don’t think that you are better than you really are. You must see yourself just as you are. Decide what you are by the faith God has given each of us.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Each one of us has one body, and that body has many parts. These parts don’t all do the same thing.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In the same way, we are many people, but in Christ we are all one body. We are the parts of that body, and each part belongs to all the others. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We all have different gifts. Each gift came because of the grace God gave us. Whoever has the gift of prophecy should use that gift in a way that fits the kind of faith they have.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Whoever has the gift of serving should serve. Whoever has the gift of teaching should teach.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Whoever has the gift of comforting others should do that. Whoever has the gift of giving to help others should give generously. Whoever has the gift of leading should work hard at it. Whoever has the gift of showing kindness to others should do it gladly. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Your love must be real. Hate what is evil. Do only what is good.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Love each other in a way that makes you feel close like brothers and sisters. And give each other more honor than you give yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>As you serve the Lord, work hard and don’t be lazy. Be excited about serving him!  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Be happy because of the hope you have. Be patient when you have troubles. Pray all the time.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Share with God’s people who need help. Look for people who need help and welcome them into your homes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Wish only good for those who treat you badly. Ask God to bless them, not curse them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When others are happy, you should be happy with them. And when others are sad, you should be sad too.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Live together in peace with each other. Don’t be proud, but be willing to be friends with people who are not important to others. Don’t think of yourself as smarter than everyone else. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If someone does you wrong, don’t try to pay them back by hurting them.
