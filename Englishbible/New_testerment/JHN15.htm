No branch can produce fruit alone. It must stay connected to the vine. It is the same with you. You cannot produce fruit alone. You must stay joined to me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“I am the vine, and you are the branches.

All the dead branches like that are gathered up, thrown into the fire and burned.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Stay joined together with me, and follow my teachings. If you do this, you can ask for anything you want, and it will be given to you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Show that you are my followers by producing much fruit.

In the same way, if you obey my commands, I will continue to love you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I have told you these things so that you can have the true happiness that I have. I want you to be completely happy.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This is what I command you: Love each other as I have loved you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The greatest love people can show is to die for their friends.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You are my friends if you do what I tell you to do.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I no longer call you servants, because servants don’t know what their master is doing.

They don’t know the one who sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If I had not come and spoken to the people of the world, they would not be guilty of sin.
