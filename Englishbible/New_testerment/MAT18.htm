He stood the child in front of the followers.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then he said, “The truth is, you must change your thinking and become like little children. If you don’t do this, you will never enter God’s kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The greatest person in God’s kingdom is the one who makes himself humble like this child. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Warns About Causes of Sin </div><div class='r'>(Mark 9:42-48; Luke 17:1-2) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“If one of these little children believes in me, and someone causes that child to sin, it will be very bad for that person. It would be better for them to have a millstone tied around their neck and be drowned in the deep sea.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I feel sorry for the people in the world because of the things that make people sin. These things must happen, but it will be very bad for anyone who causes them to happen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“If your hand or your foot makes you sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns forever.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If your eye makes you sin, take it out and throw it away. It is better for you to have only one eye and have eternal life than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Uses a Story About a Lost Sheep </div><div class='r'>(Luke 15:3-7) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“Be careful. Don’t think these little children are not important. I tell you that these children have angels in heaven. And those angels are always with my Father in heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Some Greek copies add verse 11: “The Son of Man came to save lost people.” See Luke 19:10.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“If a man has 100 sheep, but one of the sheep is lost, what will he do? He will leave the other 99 sheep on the hill and go look for the lost sheep. Right?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if he finds the lost sheep, he is happier about that one sheep than about the 99 sheep that were never lost. I can assure you,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>in the same way your Father in heaven does not want any of these little children to be lost. </div><div class='s'>When Someone Hurts You </div><div class='r'>(Luke 17:3) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“If your brother or sister in God’s family does something wrong, go and tell them what they did wrong. Do this when you are alone with them. If they listen to you, then you have helped them to be your brother or sister again.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But if they refuse to listen, go to them again and take one or two people with you. Then there will be two or three people who will be able to tell all that happened.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Then … happened See Deuteronomy 19:15.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If they refuse to listen to them, tell the church.

Seven times?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “I tell you, you must forgive them more than seven times.

So the master ordered that he and everything he owned be sold, even his wife and children. The money would be used to pay the king what the servant owed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>“But the servant fell on his knees and begged, ‘Be patient with me.

He let him go free. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“Later, that same servant found another servant who owed him a hundred silver coins.

He told the judge that the other servant owed him money, and that servant was put in jail until he could pay everything he owed.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>All the other servants saw what happened. They felt very sorry for the man. So they went and told their master everything that happened. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>“Then the master called his servant in and said, ‘You evil servant. You begged me to forgive your debt, and I said you did not have to pay anything!  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So you should have given that other man who serves with you the same mercy I gave you.’  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The master was very angry, so he put the servant in jail to be punished. And he had to stay in jail until he could pay everything he owed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>“This king did the same as my heavenly Father will do to you.
