<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Greater Than Moses </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So, my brothers and sisters, those chosen by God to be his holy people, think about Jesus. He is the one we believe God sent to save us and to be our high priest.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God made him our high priest, and he was faithful to God just as Moses was. He did everything God wanted him to do in God’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When someone builds a house, people will honor the builder more than the house. It is the same with Jesus. He should have more honor than Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Every house is built by someone, but God built everything.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moses was faithful as a servant in God’s whole house. He told people what God would say in the future.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Christ is faithful in ruling God’s house as the Son. And we are God’s house, if we remain confident of the great hope we are glad to say we have. </div><div class='s'>We Must Continue to Follow God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So it is just as the Holy Spirit says: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“If you hear God’s voice today, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>don’t be stubborn as you were in the past, </div><div class='q'>when you turned against God. </div><div class='q2'>That was the day you tested God in the desert. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For 40 years in the desert, your people saw what I did. </div><div class='q2'>But they tested me and my patience. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So I was angry with them. </div><div class='q2'>I said, ‘Their thoughts are always wrong. </div><div class='q2'>They have never understood my ways.’ </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So I was angry and made a promise: </div><div class='q2'>‘They will never enter my place of rest.’ ” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA095.htm#V7'>Psalm 95:7-11</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So, brothers and sisters, be careful that none of you has the evil thoughts that cause so much doubt that you stop following the living God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But encourage each other every day, while you still have something called “today.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> today This word is taken from verse 7. It means it is important to do this now, while there is still opportunity.</span></a>” Help each other so that none of you will be fooled by sin and become too hard to change.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>We have the honor of sharing in all that Christ has if we continue until the end to have the sure faith we had in the beginning.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>That’s why the Spirit said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“If you hear God’s voice today, </div><div class='q2'>don’t be stubborn as in the past </div><div class='q2'>when you turned against God.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA095.htm#V7'>Psalm 95:7-8</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Who were those who heard God’s voice and turned against him? It was all the people Moses led out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And who was God angry with for 40 years? He was angry with those who sinned. And their dead bodies were left in the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And which people was God talking to when he promised that they would never enter his place of rest? He was talking to those who did not obey him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So we see that they were not allowed to enter and have God’s rest, because they did not believe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
