<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='s'>Don’t Criticize Others </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Be willing to accept those who still have doubts about what believers can do. And don’t argue with them about their different ideas.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Some people believe they can eat any kind of food,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> any kind of food The Jewish law said there were some foods that Jews could not eat. When they became followers of Christ, some of them did not understand that they could now eat all foods.</span></a> but those who have doubts eat only vegetables.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Those who know they can eat any kind of food must not feel that they are better than those who eat only vegetables. And those who eat only vegetables must not decide that those who eat all foods are wrong. God has accepted them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You cannot judge the servants of someone else. Their own master decides if they are doing right or wrong. And the Lord’s servants will be right, because the Lord is able to make them right. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Some people might believe that one day is more important than another. And others might believe that every day is the same. Everyone should be sure about their beliefs in their own mind.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Those who think one day is more important than other days are doing that for the Lord. And those who eat all kinds of food are doing that for the Lord. Yes, they give thanks to God for that food. And those who refuse to eat some foods do that for the Lord. They also give thanks to God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>We don’t live or die just for ourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If we live, we are living for the Lord. And if we die, we are dying for the Lord. So living or dying, we belong to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>That is why Christ died and rose from death to live again—so that he could be Lord over those who have died and those who are living. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So why do you judge your brother or sister in Christ? Or why do you think that you are better than they are? We will all stand before God, and he will judge us all.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yes, the Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“ ‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, </div><div class='q2'>‘Everyone will bow before me; </div><div class='q2'>everyone will say that I am God.’ ” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA45.htm#V23'>Isaiah 45:23</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So each of us will have to explain to God about the things we do. </div><div class='s'>Don’t Cause Others to Sin </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So we should stop judging each other. Let’s decide not to do anything that will cause a problem for a brother or sister or hurt their faith.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I know that there is no food that is wrong to eat. The Lord Jesus is the one who convinced me of that. But if someone believes that something is wrong, then it is wrong for that person. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If you hurt the faith of your brother or sister because of something you eat, you are not really following the way of love. Don’t destroy anyone’s faith by eating something they think is wrong. Christ died for them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Don’t allow what is good for you to become something they say is evil.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In God’s kingdom, what we eat and drink is not important. Here is what is important: a right way of life, peace, and joy—all from the Holy Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whoever serves Christ by living this way is pleasing God, and they will be accepted by others. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So let’s try as hard as we can to do what will bring peace. Let’s do whatever will help each other grow stronger in faith.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Don’t let the eating of food destroy the work of God. All food is right to eat, but it is wrong for anyone to eat something that hurts the faith of another person.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that hurts the faith of your brother or sister. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You should keep your beliefs about these things a secret between yourself and God. It is a blessing to be able to do what you think is right without feeling guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But anyone who eats something without being sure it is right is doing wrong. That is because they did not believe it was right. And if you do anything that you believe is not right, it is sin. </div><ul class='tnav'>
