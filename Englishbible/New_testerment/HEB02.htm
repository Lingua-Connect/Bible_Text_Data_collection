We must be careful so that we will not be pulled away from the true way.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The teaching that God spoke through angels was shown to be true. And every time his people did something against that teaching, they were punished for what they did. They were punished when they did not obey that teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So surely we also will be punished if we don’t pay attention to the salvation we have that is so great. It was the Lord Jesus who first told people about it. And those who heard him proved to us that it is true.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>God also proved it by using miraculous signs, wonders, and all kinds of miracles. And he proved it by giving people various gifts through the Holy Spirit in just the way he wanted. </div><div class='s'>Christ Became Like People <br/> to Save Them </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>God did not choose angels to be the rulers over the new world that was coming. That future world is the world we have been talking about.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>It is written some place in the Scriptures, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Why are people so important to you? </div><div class='q2'>Why do you even think about them? </div><div class='q'>Why do you care about the son of man<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> son of man This can mean any human, but the name “Son of Man” (see “Son of Man” in the Word List) is often used to mean Jesus, who showed what God planned for all people to be.</span></a>? </div><div class='q2'>Is he so important? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For a short time you made him lower than the angels. </div><div class='q2'>You crowned him with glory and honor. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You put everything under his control.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> control Literally, “feet.”</span></a>” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA008.htm#V4'>Psalm 8:4-6</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>If God put everything under his control, then there was nothing left that he did not rule. But we don’t yet see him ruling over everything.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For a short time Jesus was made lower than the angels, but now we see him wearing a crown of glory and honor because he suffered and died. Because of God’s grace, Jesus died for everyone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>God—the one who made all things and for whose glory all things exist—wanted many people to be his children and share his glory. So he did what he needed to do. He made perfect the one who leads those people to salvation. He made Jesus a perfect Savior through his suffering. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jesus, the one who makes people holy, and those who are made holy are from the same family. So he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“God, I will tell my brothers and sisters about you. </div><div class='q2'>Before all your people I will sing your praises.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA022.htm#V22'>Psalm 22:22</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He also says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I will trust in God.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA08.htm#V17'>Isaiah 8:17</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>And he says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I am here, and with me are the children God has given me.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA08.htm#V18'>Isaiah 8:18</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>These children are people with physical bodies. So Jesus himself became like them and had the same experiences they have. Jesus did this so that, by dying, he could destroy the one who has the power of death—the devil.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Jesus became like these people and died so that he could free them. They were like slaves all their lives because of their fear of death.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Clearly, it is not angels that Jesus helps. He helps the people who are from Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For this reason, Jesus had to be made like us, his brothers and sisters, in every way. He became like people so that he could be their merciful and faithful high priest in service to God. Then he could bring forgiveness for the people’s sins.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And now he can help those who are tempted. He is able to help because he himself suffered and was tempted. </div><ul class='tnav'>
