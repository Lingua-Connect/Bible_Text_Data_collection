</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Greetings from Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ. </div><div class='p'>To all of you in Philippi who are God’s holy people in Christ Jesus, including your elders<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> elders Here, literally, “overseers.” See “elders (New Testament)” in the Word List.</span></a> and special servants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class='s'>Paul’s Prayer </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I thank God every time I remember you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And I always pray for all of you with joy.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I thank God for the help you gave me while I told people the Good News. You helped from the first day you believed until now.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I am sure that the good work God began in you will continue until he completes it on the day when Jesus Christ comes again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I know I am right to think like this about all of you because you are so close to my heart. This is because you have all played such an important part in God’s grace to me—now, during this time that I am in prison, and whenever I am defending and proving the truth of the Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>God knows that I want very much to see you. I love all of you with the love of Christ Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This is my prayer for you: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='mi'>that your love will grow more and more; that you will have knowledge and understanding with your love;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>that you will see the difference between what is important and what is not and choose what is important; that you will be pure and blameless for the coming of Christ;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>that your life will be full of the many good works that are produced by Jesus Christ to bring glory and praise to God. </div><div class='s'>Paul’s Troubles Help the Lord’s Work </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that all that has happened to me has helped to spread the Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>All the Roman guards and all the others here know that I am in prison for serving Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>My being in prison has caused most of the believers to put their trust in the Lord and to show more courage in telling people God’s message. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Some people are telling the message about Christ because they are jealous and bitter. Others do it because they want to help.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They are doing it out of love. They know that God gave me the work of defending the Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But those others tell about Christ because of their selfish ambition. Their reason for doing it is wrong. They only do it because they think it will make trouble for me in prison.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But that doesn’t matter. What is important is that they are telling people about Christ, whether they are sincere or not. So I am glad they are doing it. </div><div class='p'>I will continue to be glad,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>because I know that your prayers and the help the Spirit of Jesus Christ gives me will cause this trouble to result in my freedom.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> freedom Or “salvation.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I am full of hope and feel sure I will not have any reason to be ashamed. I am certain I will continue to have the same boldness to speak freely that I always have. I will let God use my life to bring more honor to Christ. It doesn’t matter whether I live or die.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>To me, the only important thing about living is Christ. And even death would be for my benefit.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> death … benefit Paul says that death would be better, because death would bring him nearer to Christ.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If I continue living here on earth, I will be able to work for the Lord. But what would I choose—to live or to die? I don’t know.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>It would be a hard choice. Sometimes I want to leave this life and be with Christ. That would be much better for me;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>however, you people need me here alive.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I am sure of this, so I know that I will stay here and be with you to help you grow and have joy in your faith.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When I am there with you again, you will be bursting with pride over what Christ Jesus did to help me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Just be sure you live as God’s people in a way that honors the Good News of Christ. Then if I come and visit you or if I am away from you, I will hear good things about you. I will know that you stand together with the same purpose and that you work together like a team to help others believe the Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And you will not be afraid of those who are against you. All of this is proof from God that you are being saved and that your enemies will be lost.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>God has blessed you in ways that serve Christ. He allowed you to believe in Christ. But that is not all. He has also given you the honor of suffering for Christ. Both of these bring glory to Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>You saw the difficulties I had to face, and you hear that I am still having troubles. Now you must face them too. </div><ul class='tnav'>
