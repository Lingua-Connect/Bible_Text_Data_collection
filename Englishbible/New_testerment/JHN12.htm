That is where Lazarus lived, the man Jesus raised from death.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>There they had a dinner for Jesus. Martha served the food, and Lazarus was one of the people eating with Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Mary brought in a pint<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> pint Literally, “<span class='tl'>litra</span>,” a Roman pound, equal to 327 grams (11.5 ounces).</span></a> of expensive perfume made of pure nard. She poured the perfume on Jesus’ feet. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. And the sweet smell from the perfume filled the whole house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’ followers, was there—the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Judas said,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“That perfume was worth a full year’s pay.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> a full year’s pay Literally, “300 denarii.” One Roman denarius, a silver coin, was the average pay for one day’s work.</span></a> It should have been sold, and the money should have been given to the poor people.”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Judas did not really care about the poor. He said this because he was a thief. He was the one who kept the moneybag for the group of followers. And he often stole money from the bag. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Don’t stop her. It was right for her to save this perfume for today—the day for me to be prepared for burial.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You will always have those who are poor with you.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> You will … with you See Deuteronomy 15:11.</span></a> But you will not always have me.” </div><div class='s'>The Plot Against Lazarus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Many of the Jews heard that Jesus was in Bethany, so they went there to see him. They also went there to see Lazarus, the one Jesus raised from death.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So the leading priests made plans to kill Lazarus too.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because of him, many Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus. That is why they wanted to kill Lazarus too. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Enters Jerusalem Like a King </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The next day the people in Jerusalem heard that Jesus was coming there. These were the crowds of people who had come to the Passover festival.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Jesus. They shouted, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“ ‘Praise<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Praise Literally, “Hosanna,” a Hebrew word used in praying to God for help. Here, it was probably a shout of celebration used in praising God or his Messiah.</span></a> Him!’ </div><div class='q2'>‘Welcome! God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’ <span class='rq'><a href='PSA118.htm#V25'>Psalm 118:25-26</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>God bless the King of Israel!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jesus found a donkey and rode on it, as the Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“Do not be afraid, people of Zion<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> people of Zion Literally, “daughter of Zion,” meaning the city of Jerusalem. See “Zion” in the Word List.</span></a>! </div><div class='q2'>Look! Your king is coming. </div><div class='q2'>He is riding on a young donkey.” <span class='rq'><a href='ZEC09.htm#V9'>Zechariah 9:9</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The followers of Jesus did not understand at that time what was happening. But after he was raised to glory, they understood that this was written about him. Then they remembered that they had done these things for him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>There were many people with Jesus when he raised Lazarus from death and told him to come out of the tomb. Now they were telling others about what Jesus did.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>That’s why so many people went out to meet him—because they had heard about this miraculous sign he did.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So the Pharisees said to each other, “Look! Our plan is not working. The people are all following him!” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Talks About Life and Death </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There were some Greeks there too. These were some of the people who went to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover festival.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, “Sir, we want to meet Jesus.”  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Philip went and told Andrew. Then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “The time has come for the Son of Man to receive his glory.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>It is a fact that a grain of wheat must fall to the ground and die before it can grow and produce much more wheat. If it never dies, it will never be more than a single seed.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whoever loves the life they have now will lose it. But whoever is willing to give up their life in this world will keep it. They will have eternal life.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Whoever serves me must follow me. My servants must be with me everywhere I am. My Father will give honor to anyone who serves me. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Talks About His Death </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>“Now I am very troubled. What should I say? Should I say, ‘Father save me from this time of suffering’? No, I came to this time so that I could suffer.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Father, do what will bring you glory!” </div><div class='p'>Then a voice came from heaven, “I have already brought glory to myself. I will do it again.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The people standing there heard the voice. They said it was thunder. </div><div class='p'>But others said, “An angel spoke to him!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Jesus said, “That voice was for you and not for me.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now is the time for the world to be judged. Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I will be lifted up<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> lifted up Meaning to be nailed to a cross and “lifted up” on it to die. It may also have a second meaning: to be “lifted up” from death to heaven. Also in verse 34.</span></a> from the earth. When that happens, I will draw all people to myself.”  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jesus said this to show how he would die. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The people said, “But our law says that the Messiah will live forever. So why do you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “The light<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> light This means Christ, as in John 1:5-9. Also, it is a symbol of goodness and truth, qualities associated with Christ and his kingdom.</span></a> will be with you for only a short time more. So walk while you have the light. Then the darkness will not catch you. People who walk in the darkness don’t know where they are going.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So put your trust in the light while you still have it. Then you will be children of light.” When Jesus finished saying these things, he went away to a place where the people could not find him. </div><div class='s'>Some Jews Refuse to Believe in Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The people saw all these miraculous signs Jesus did, but they still did not believe in him.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>This was to give full meaning to what Isaiah the prophet said: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Lord, who believed what we told them? </div><div class='q2'>Who has seen the Lord’s power?” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA53.htm#V1'>Isaiah 53:1</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>This is why the people could not believe. Because Isaiah also said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>“God made the people blind. </div><div class='q2'>He closed their minds. </div><div class='q'>He did this so that they would not see with their eyes </div><div class='q2'>and understand with their minds. </div><div class='q'>He did it so that they would not turn </div><div class='q2'>and be healed.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA06.htm#V10'>Isaiah 6:10</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ divine greatness. So he spoke about him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But many people believed in Jesus. Even many of the Jewish leaders believed in him, but they were afraid of the Pharisees, so they did not say openly that they believed. They were afraid they would be ordered to stay out of the synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>They loved praise from people more than praise from God. </div><div class='s'>Jesus’ Teaching Will Judge People </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Then Jesus said loudly, “Everyone who believes in me is really believing in the one who sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Everyone who sees me is really seeing the one who sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>I came into this world as a light. I came so that everyone who believes in me will not stay in darkness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>“I did not come into the world to judge people. I came to save the people in the world. So I am not the one who judges those who hear my teaching and do not obey.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>But there is a judge for all those who refuse to believe in me and do not accept what I say. The message I have spoken will judge them on the last day.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>That is because what I taught was not from myself. The Father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And I know that whatever he says to do will bring eternal life. So the things I say are exactly what the Father told me to say.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
