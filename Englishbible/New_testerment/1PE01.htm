</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Greetings from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. </div><div class='p'>To God’s chosen people who are away from their homes—people scattered all over the areas of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God planned long ago to choose you and to make you his holy people, which is the Spirit’s work. God wanted you to obey him and to be made clean by the blood sacrifice<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> made clean … sacrifice Or “sprinkled with the blood,” which probably compares the beginning of the new agreement by the blood sacrifice of Christ (Mark 14:24) with Moses’ sprinkling the blood of animal sacrifices on the people of Israel to seal the agreement God made with them (Exodus 24:3-8). See also Heb. 9:15-26.</span></a> of Jesus Christ. </div><div class='p'>I pray that you will enjoy more and more of God’s grace and peace. </div><div class='s'>A Living Hope </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. God has great mercy, and because of his mercy he gave us a new life. This new life brings us a living hope through Jesus Christ’s resurrection from death.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Now we wait to receive the blessings God has for his children. These blessings are kept for you in heaven. They cannot be ruined or be destroyed or lose their beauty. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>God’s power protects you through your faith, and it keeps you safe until your salvation comes. That salvation is ready to be given to you at the end of time.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I know the thought of that is exciting, even if you must suffer through different kinds of troubles for a short time now.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>These troubles test your faith and prove that it is pure. And such faith is worth more than gold. Gold can be proved to be pure by fire, but gold will ruin. When your faith is proven to be pure, the result will be praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ comes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You have not seen Christ, but still you love him. You can’t see him now, but you believe in him. You are filled with a wonderful and heavenly joy that cannot be explained.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Your faith has a goal, and you are reaching that goal—your salvation. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The prophets studied carefully and tried to learn about this salvation. They spoke about the grace that was coming to you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Spirit of Christ was in those prophets. And the Spirit was telling about the sufferings that would happen to Christ and about the glory that would come after those sufferings. The prophets tried to learn about what the Spirit was showing them—when it would happen and what the world would be like at that time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It was made clear to them that their service was not for themselves. They were serving you when they told about the things you have now heard. You heard them from those who told you the Good News with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even the angels would like very much to know more about these things you were told. </div><div class='s'>A Call to Holy Living </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So prepare your minds for service. With complete self-control put all your hope in the grace that will be yours when Jesus Christ comes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In the past you did not have the understanding you have now, so you did the evil things you wanted to do. But now you are children of God, so you should obey him and not live the way you did before.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Be holy in everything you do, just as God is holy. He is the one who chose you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In the Scriptures God says, “Be holy, because I am holy.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Leviticus 11:44, 45; 19:2; 20:7.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>You pray to God and call him Father, but he will judge everyone the same way—by what they do. So while you are visiting here on earth, you should live with respect for God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You know that in the past the way you were living was useless. It was a way of life you learned from those who lived before you. But you were saved from that way of living. You were bought, but not with things that ruin like gold or silver.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You were bought with the precious blood of Christ’s death. He was a pure and perfect sacrificial Lamb.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Christ was chosen before the world was made, but he was shown to the world in these last times for you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>You believe in God through Christ. God is the one who raised him from death and gave honor to him. So your faith and your hope are in God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You have made yourselves pure by obeying the truth. Now you can have true love for your brothers and sisters. So love each other deeply—with all your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>You have been born again. This new life did not come from something that dies. It came from something that cannot die. You were born again through God’s life-giving message that lasts forever.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Our lives are like the grass of spring, </div><div class='q2'>and any glory we enjoy is like the beauty of a wildflower. </div><div class='q'>The grass dries up and dies, </div><div class='q2'>and the flower falls to the ground. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But the word of the Lord lasts forever.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA40.htm#V6'>Isaiah 40:6-8</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>And that word is the Good News that was told to you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
