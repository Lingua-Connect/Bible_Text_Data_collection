<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='s'>John Sends Men <br/> to Ask Jesus a Question </div><div class='r'>(Luke 7:18-35) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When Jesus finished these instructions for his twelve followers, he left there. He went to the towns in Galilee to teach the people and tell them God’s message. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>When John was in prison, he heard about the things that were happening—things the Messiah would do. So he sent some of his followers to Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They asked him, “Are you the one we have been expecting, or should we wait for someone else?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Go tell John what you have heard and seen:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The blind can see. The crippled can walk. People with leprosy are healed. The deaf can hear. The dead are brought back to life. And the Good News is being told to the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Great blessings belong to those who don’t have a problem accepting me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When John’s followers left, Jesus began talking to the people about John. He said, “What did you people go out to the desert to see? Someone who is weak, like a stem of grass<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> stem of grass Literally, “reed.”</span></a> blowing in the wind?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Really, what did you expect to see? Someone dressed in fine clothes? Of course not. People who wear fine clothes are all in kings’ palaces.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, John is a prophet. But I tell you, he is more than that.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>This Scripture was written about him: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘Listen! I will send my messenger ahead of you. </div><div class='q2'>He will prepare the way for you.’ <span class='rq'><a href='MAL03.htm#V1'>Malachi 3:1</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“The truth is that John the Baptizer is greater than anyone who has ever come into this world. But even the least important person in God’s kingdom is greater than John.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Since the time John the Baptizer came until now, God’s kingdom has been going forward strongly.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> has been … strongly Or “has suffered violence.”</span></a> And people have been trying to take control of it by force.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Before John came, the Law of Moses and all the prophets told about the things that would happen.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if you believe what they said, then John is Elijah.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Elijah See Mal. 4:5-6.</span></a> He is the one they said would come.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You people who hear me, listen! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“What can I say about the people who live today? What are they like? The people today are like children sitting in the marketplace. One group of children calls to the other group, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>‘We played flute music for you, </div><div class='q2'>but you did not dance; </div><div class='q'>we sang a funeral song, </div><div class='q2'>but you were not sad.’ </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Why do I say people are like that? Because John came, not eating like other people or drinking wine, and people say, ‘He has a demon inside him.’  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and people say, ‘Look at him! He eats too much and drinks too much wine. He’s a friend of tax collectors and other sinners.’ But wisdom is shown to be right by what it does.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Warns People Who <br/> Refuse to Believe </div><div class='r'>(Luke 10:13-15) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Jesus criticized the cities where he did most of his miracles. He criticized these cities because the people there did not change their lives and stop sinning.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus said, “It will be bad for you Chorazin! It will be bad for you Bethsaida! I did many miracles in you. If these same miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon, the people there would have changed their lives a long time ago. They would have worn sackcloth and put ashes on themselves to show that they were sorry for their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But I tell you, on the day of judgment it will be worse for you than for Tyre and Sidon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No! You will be thrown down to the place of death. I did many miracles in you. If these same miracles had happened in Sodom, the people there would have stopped sinning, and it would still be a city today.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But I tell you, it will be worse for you in the day of judgment than for Sodom.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Offers Rest to His People </div><div class='r'>(Luke 10:21-22) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth. I am thankful that you have hidden these things from those who are so wise and so smart. But you have shown them to people who are like little children.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Yes, Father, you did this because it’s what you really wanted to do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>“My Father has given me everything. No one knows the Son—only the Father knows the Son. And no one knows the Father—only the Son knows the Father. And the only people who will know about the Father are those the Son chooses to tell. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“Come to me all of you who are tired from the heavy burden you have been forced to carry. I will give you rest.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Accept my teaching.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Accept my teaching Literally, “Take my yoke upon you.” A yoke was put on the neck of a work animal for pulling a load.
