<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>“I have told you all this so that you won’t lose your faith when you face troubles.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>People will tell you to leave their synagogues and never come back. In fact, the time will come when they will think that killing you would be doing service for God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They will do this because they have not known the Father, and they have not known me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I have told you all this now to prepare you. So when the time comes for these things to happen, you will remember that I warned you. </div><div class='s'>The Work of the Holy Spirit </div><div class='p'>“I did not tell you these things at the beginning, because I was with you then.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now I am going back to the one who sent me. And none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But you are filled with sadness because I have told you all this.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Let me assure you, it is better for you that I go away. I say this because when I go away I will send the Helper to you. But if I did not go, the Helper would not come. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“When the Helper comes, he will show the people of the world how wrong they are about sin, about being right with God, and about judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He will prove that they are guilty of sin, because they don’t believe in me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He will show them how wrong they are about how to be right with God. The Helper will do this, because I am going to the Father. You will not see me then.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he will show them how wrong their judgment is, because their leader<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> their leader Literally, “the ruler of this world,” meaning Satan. See “Satan” in the Word List.</span></a> has already been condemned. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“I have so much more to tell you, but it is too much for you to accept now.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But when the Spirit of truth comes, he will lead you into all truth. He will not speak his own words. He will speak only what he hears and will tell you what will happen in the future.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Spirit of truth will bring glory to me by telling you what he receives from me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All that the Father has is mine. That is why I said that the Spirit will tell you what he receives from me. </div><div class='s'>Sadness Will Turn Into Happiness </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“After a short time you won’t see me. Then after another short time you will see me again.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Some of the followers said to each other, “What does he mean when he says, ‘After a short time you won’t see me. Then after another short time you will see me again’? And what does he mean when he says, ‘Because I am going to the Father’?”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They also asked, “What does he mean by ‘a short time’? We don’t understand what he is saying.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus saw that the followers wanted to ask him about this. So he said to them, “Are you asking each other what I meant when I said, ‘After a short time you won’t see me. Then after another short time you will see me again’?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The truth is, you will cry and be sad, but the world will be happy. You will be sad, but then your sadness will change to happiness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“When a woman gives birth to a baby, she has pain, because her time has come. But when her baby is born, she forgets the pain. She forgets because she is so happy that a child has been born into the world.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>It is the same with you. Now you are sad, but I will see you again, and you will be happy. You will have a joy that no one can take away.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In that day you will not have to ask me about anything. And I assure you, my Father will give you anything you ask him for in my name.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>You have never asked for anything in this way before. But ask in my name, and you will receive. And you will have the fullest joy possible. </div><div class='s'>Victory Over the World </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“I have told you these things, using words that hide the meaning. But the time will come when I will not use words like that to tell you things. I will speak to you in plain words about the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then you will be able to ask the Father for things in my name. I’m not saying that I will have to ask the Father for you.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The Father himself loves you because you have loved me. And he loves you because you have believed that I came from God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I came from the Father into the world. Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then his followers said, “You are already speaking plainly to us. You are not using words that hide the meaning.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>We can see now that you know all things. You answer our questions even before we ask them. This makes us believe that you came from God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Jesus said, “So now you believe?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Listen to me. A time is coming when you will be scattered, each to his own home. In fact, that time is already here. You will leave me, and I will be alone. But I am never really alone, because the Father is with me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>“I have told you these things so that you can have peace in me. In this world you will have troubles. But be brave! I have defeated the world!” </div><ul class='tnav'>
