<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='s'>God’s People Sing a New Song </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, who was standing on Mount Zion.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Mount Zion Another name for Jerusalem, here meaning the spiritual city where God’s people live with him.</span></a> There were 144,000 people with him. They all had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And I heard a sound from heaven as loud as the crashing of floodwaters or claps of thunder. But it sounded like harpists playing their harps.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The people sang a new song before the throne and before the four living beings and the elders. The only ones who could learn the new song were the 144,000 who had been bought from the earth. No one else could learn it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>These are the ones who did not do sinful things with women. They kept themselves pure. Now they follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were bought from among the people of the earth as the first to be offered to God and the Lamb.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They are not guilty of telling lies; they are without fault. </div><div class='s'>The Three Angels </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then I saw another angel flying high in the air. The angel had the eternal Good News to announce to the people living on earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and race of people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The angel said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him praise. The time has come for God to judge all people. Worship God. He made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the springs of water.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the second angel followed the first angel and said, “She is destroyed! The great city of Babylon is destroyed! She made all the nations drink the wine of her sexual sin and of God’s anger.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A third angel followed the first two angels. This third angel said in a loud voice, “God will punish all those who worship the beast and the beast’s idol and agree to have the beast’s mark on their forehead or on their hand.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They will drink the wine of God’s anger. This wine is prepared with all its strength in the cup of God’s anger. They will be tortured with burning sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the smoke from their burning pain will rise forever and ever. There will be no rest, day or night, for those who worship the beast and its idol or who wear the mark of its name.”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This means that God’s holy people must be patient. They must obey God’s commands and keep their faith in Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then I heard a voice from heaven. It said, “Write this: From now on there are great blessings for those who belong to the Lord when they die.” </div><div class='p'>The Spirit says, “Yes, that is true. They will rest from their hard work. What they have done will stay with them.” </div><div class='s'>The Earth Is Harvested </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I looked and there before me, sitting on a white cloud, was one who looked like the Son of Man. He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then another angel came out of the temple. This angel called to the one who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and gather from the earth. The time to harvest has come, and the fruit on the earth is ripe.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the one who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth. And the earth was harvested. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven. This angel also had a sharp sickle.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And then another angel, one with power over the fire, came from the altar. He called to the angel with the sharp sickle and said, “Take your sharp sickle and gather the bunches of grapes from the earth’s vine. The earth’s grapes are ripe.”  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The angel swung his sickle over the earth. He gathered the earth’s grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s anger.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The grapes were squeezed in the winepress outside the city. Blood flowed out of the winepress. It rose as high as the heads of the horses for a distance of 200 miles.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 200 miles Literally, “1600 <span class='tl'>stadia,</span>” a little less than 300 km.</span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
