<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Early in the morning he went back to the Temple area. The people all came to him, and he sat and taught them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought a woman they had caught in bed with a man who was not her husband. They forced her to stand in front of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The Law of Moses commands us to stone to death any such woman. What do you say we should do?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They were saying this to trick Jesus. They wanted to catch him saying something wrong so that they could have a charge against him. But Jesus stooped down and started writing on the ground with his finger.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Jewish leaders continued to ask him their question. So he stood up and said, “Anyone here who has never sinned should throw the first stone at her.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Jesus stooped down again and wrote on the ground. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When they heard this, they began to leave one by one. The older men left first, and then the others. Jesus was left alone with the woman standing there in front of him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He looked up again and said to her, “Where did they all go? Did no one judge you guilty?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>She answered, “No one, sir.” </div><div class='p'>Then Jesus said, “I don’t judge you either. You can go now, but don’t sin again.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The oldest and best Greek copies do not have verses 7:53-8:11. Other copies have this section in different places.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is the Light of the World </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Later, Jesus talked to the people again. He said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never live in darkness. They will have the light that gives life.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the Pharisees said to Jesus, “When you talk about yourself, you are the only one to say that these things are true. So we cannot accept what you say.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Yes, I am saying these things about myself. But people can believe what I say, because I know where I came from. And I know where I am going. But you don’t know where I came from or where I am going.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You judge me the way people judge other people. I don’t judge anyone.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But if I judge, my judging is true, because when I judge I am not alone. The Father who sent me is with me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Your own law says that when two witnesses say the same thing, you must accept what they say.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself. And the Father who sent me is my other witness.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The people asked, “Where is your father?” </div><div class='p'>Jesus answered, “You don’t know me or my Father. But if you knew me, you would know my Father too.”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the Temple area, near the room where the Temple offerings were kept. But no one arrested him, because the right time for him had not yet come. </div><div class='s'>Some Jews Don’t Understand Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Again, Jesus said to the people, “I will leave you. You will look for me, but you will die in your sin. You cannot come where I am going.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the Jewish leaders asked themselves, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he said, ‘You cannot come where I am going’?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But Jesus said to them, “You people are from here below, but I am from above. You belong to this world, but I don’t belong to this world.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I told you that you would die in your sins. Yes, if you don’t believe that I AM,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> I AM This is like the name of God used in the Old Testament. See Isaiah 41:4; 43:10; Exodus 3:14. However, it can also mean “I am he,” meaning “I am the Messiah.” Also in verses 28, 58.</span></a> you will die in your sins.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They asked, “Then who are you?” </div><div class='p'>Jesus answered, “I am what I have told you from the beginning.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I have much more I could say to judge you. But I tell people only what I have heard from the one who sent me, and he speaks the truth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They did not understand who he was talking about. He was telling them about the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So he said to them, “You will lift up<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> lift up Meaning to be nailed to a cross and “lifted up” on it to die. It may also have a second meaning: to be “lifted up” from death to heaven.</span></a> the Son of Man. Then you will know that I AM. You will know that whatever I do is not by my own authority. You will know that I say only what the Father has taught me.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The one who sent me is with me. I always do what pleases him. So he has not left me alone.”  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>While he was saying these things, many people believed in him. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Talks About Freedom From Sin </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him, “If you continue to accept and obey my teaching, you are really my followers.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They answered, “We are Abraham’s descendants. And we have never been slaves. So why do you say that we will be free?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus said, “The truth is, everyone who sins is a slave—a slave to sin.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>A slave does not stay with a family forever. But a son belongs to the family forever.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So if the Son makes you free, you are really free.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>I know you are Abraham’s descendants. But you want to kill me, because you don’t want to accept my teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I am telling you what my Father has shown me. But you do what your father has told you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They said, “Our father is Abraham.” </div><div class='p'>Jesus said, “If you were really Abraham’s descendants, you would do what Abraham did.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>I am someone who has told you the truth I heard from God. But you are trying to kill me. Abraham did nothing like that.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>So you are doing what your own father did.” </div><div class='p'>But they said, “We are not like children who never knew who their father was. God is our Father. He is the only Father we have.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “If God were really your Father, you would love me. I came from God, and now I am here. I did not come by my own authority. God sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>You don’t understand the things I say, because you cannot accept my teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Your father is the devil. You belong to him. You want to do what he wants. He was a murderer from the beginning. He was always against the truth. There is no truth in him. He is like the lies he tells. Yes, the devil is a liar. He is the father of lies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>“I am telling you the truth, and that’s why you don’t believe me.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Can any of you prove that I am guilty of sin? If I tell the truth, why don’t you believe me?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Whoever belongs to God accepts what he says. But you don’t accept what God says, because you don’t belong to God.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Talks About Himself <br/> and Abraham </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>The Jews there answered, “We say you are a Samaritan. We say a demon is making you crazy! Are we not right when we say this?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “I have no demon in me. I give honor to my Father, but you give no honor to me.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>I am not trying to get honor for myself. There is one who wants this honor for me. He is the judge.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>I promise you, whoever continues to obey my teaching will never die.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>The Jews said to Jesus, “Now we know that you have a demon in you! Even Abraham and the prophets died. But you say, ‘Whoever obeys my teaching will never die.’  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Do you think you are greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “If I give honor to myself, that honor is worth nothing. The one who gives me honor is my Father. And you say that he is your God.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>But you don’t really know him. I know him. If I said I did not know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I obey what he says.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Your father Abraham was very happy that he would see the day when I came. He saw that day and was happy.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>The Jews said to Jesus, “What? How can you say you have seen Abraham? You are not even 50 years old!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “The fact is, before Abraham was born, I AM.”  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>When he said this, they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus hid, and then he left the Temple area. </div><ul class='tnav'>
