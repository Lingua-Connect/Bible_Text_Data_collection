He says we should not pay taxes to Caesar. He calls himself the Messiah, a king.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” </div><div class='p'>Jesus answered, “Yes, what you say is true.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Pilate said to the leading priests and the people, “I find nothing wrong with this man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they kept on saying, “His teaching is causing trouble all over Judea. He began in Galilee, and now he is here!” </div><div class='s'>Pilate Sends Jesus to Herod </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Pilate heard this and asked if Jesus was from Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He learned that Jesus was under Herod’s authority. Herod was in Jerusalem at that time, so Pilate sent Jesus to him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When Herod saw Jesus, he was very happy. He had heard all about him and had wanted to meet him for a long time. Herod wanted to see a miracle, so he was hoping that Jesus would do one.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He asked him many questions, but Jesus said nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The leading priests and teachers of the law were standing there shouting things against Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Herod and his soldiers laughed at him. They made fun of him by dressing him in clothes like kings wear. Then Herod sent him back to Pilate.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>In the past Pilate and Herod had always been enemies. But on that day they became friends. </div><div class='s'>Pilate Tries but Fails to Free Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:15-26; Mark 15:6-15; John 18:39—19:16) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Pilate called all the people together with the leading priests and the Jewish leaders.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He said to them, “You brought this man to me. You said he was trying to change the people. But I judged him before you all and have not found him guilty of the things you say he has done.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Herod didn’t find him guilty either. He sent him back to us. Look, he has done nothing bad enough for the death penalty.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So, after I punish him a little, I will let him go free.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A few Greek copies add verse 17: “Every year at the Passover festival, Pilate had to release one prisoner to the people.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But they all shouted, “Kill him! Let Barabbas go free!”  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>(Barabbas was a man who was in jail for starting a riot in the city and for murder.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Pilate wanted to let Jesus go free. So again Pilate told them that he would let him go.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But they shouted again, “Kill him! Kill him on a cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A third time Pilate said to the people, “Why? What wrong has he done? He is not guilty. I can find no reason to kill him. So I will let him go free after I punish him a little.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the people continued to shout. They demanded that Jesus be killed on a cross. Their shouting got so loud that  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Pilate decided to give them what they wanted.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They wanted Barabbas to go free—the one who was in jail for starting a riot and for murder. Pilate let Barabbas go free. And he handed Jesus over to be killed. This is what the people wanted. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:32-44; Mark 15:21-32; John 19:17-19) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The soldiers led Jesus away. At that same time there was a man from Cyrene named Simon coming into the city from the fields. The soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’ cross and walk behind him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A large crowd followed Jesus. Some of the women were sad and crying. They felt sorry for him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But Jesus turned and said to the women, “Women of Jerusalem, don’t cry for me. Cry for yourselves and for your children too.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The time is coming when people will say, ‘The women who cannot have babies are the ones God has blessed. It’s really a blessing that they have no children to care for.’  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then the people will say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ They will say to the hills, ‘Cover us!’<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Hosea 10:8.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If this can happen to someone who is good, what will happen to those who are guilty?<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> If this can happen … guilty Literally, “If they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?”</span></a>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>There were also two criminals led out with Jesus to be killed.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They were led to a place called “The Skull.” There the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross. They also nailed the criminals to crosses beside Jesus—one on the right and the other on the left. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Father, forgive them.

He saved others, didn’t he?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Even the soldiers laughed at Jesus and made fun of him. They came and offered him some sour wine.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>(At the top of the cross these words were written: “<span class='sc'>this is the king of the jews</span>.”) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>One of the criminals hanging there began to shout insults at Jesus: “Aren’t you the Messiah?

Also, there were some women who had followed Jesus from Galilee. They all stood far away from the cross and watched these things. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Buried </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; John 19:38-42) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50-51&#160;</span>A man named Joseph was there from the Jewish town of Arimathea.
