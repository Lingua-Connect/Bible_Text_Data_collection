He said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“God’s kingdom is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He invited some people to the feast. When it was ready, the king sent his servants to tell the people to come. But they refused to come to the king’s feast. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“Then the king sent some more servants. He said to them, ‘I have already invited the people. So tell them that my feast is ready. I have killed my best bulls and calves to be eaten. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“But when the servants told the people to come, they refused to listen. They all went to do other things. One went to work in his field, and another went to his business.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Some of the other people grabbed the servants, beat them, and killed them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The king was very angry. He sent his army to kill those who murdered his servants. And the army burned their city. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“After that the king said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready. I invited those people, but they were not good enough to come to my feast.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So go to the street corners and invite everyone you see. Tell them to come to my feast.’  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So the servants went into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, good and bad alike, and brought them to where the wedding feast was ready. And the place was filled with guests. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“When the king came in to meet the guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in the right clothes for a wedding.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The king said, ‘Friend, how were you allowed to come in here? You are not wearing the right clothes.’ But the man said nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the king told some servants, ‘Tie this man’s hands and feet. Throw him out into the darkness, where people are crying and grinding their teeth with pain.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“Yes, many people are invited. But only a few are chosen.” </div><div class='s'>The Jewish Leaders Try to Trick Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the Pharisees left the place where Jesus was teaching. They made plans to catch him saying something wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They sent some men to Jesus. They were some of their own followers and some from the group called Herodians. They said, “Teacher, we know you are an honest man. We know you teach the truth about God’s way. You are not afraid of what others think about you. All people are the same to you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So tell us what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him. So he said, “You hypocrites! Why are you trying to catch me saying something wrong?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Show me a coin used for paying the tax.” They showed Jesus a silver coin.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then he asked, “Whose picture is on the coin? And whose name is written on the coin?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They answered, “It is Caesar’s picture and Caesar’s name.” </div><div class='p'>Then Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When they heard what Jesus said, they were amazed. They left him and went away. </div><div class='s'>Some Sadducees Try to Trick Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>That same day some Sadducees came to Jesus. (Sadducees believe that no one will rise from death.) The Sadducees asked Jesus a question.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They said, “Teacher, Moses told us that if a married man dies and had no children, his brother must marry the woman. Then they will have children for the dead brother.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> if … dead brother See Deuteronomy 25:5, 6.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>There were seven brothers among us. The first brother married but died. He had no children. So his brother married the woman.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the second brother also died. The same thing happened to the third brother and all the other brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The woman was the last to die.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But all seven men had married her. So when people rise from death, whose wife will she be?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “You are so wrong! You don’t know what the Scriptures say. And you don’t know anything about God’s power.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>At the time when people rise from death, there will be no marriage. People will not be married to each other. Everyone will be like the angels in heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Surely you have read what God said to you about people rising from death.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>God said, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Exodus 3:6.</span></a> So they were not still dead, because he is the God only of living people.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>When the people heard this, they were amazed at Jesus’ teaching. </div><div class='s'>Which Command Is <br/> the Most Important? </div><div class='r'>(Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The Pharisees learned that Jesus had made the Sadducees look so foolish that they stopped trying to argue with him. So the Pharisees had a meeting.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then one of them, an expert in the Law of Moses, asked Jesus a question to test him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He said, “Teacher, which command in the law is the most important?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.’<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deuteronomy 6:5.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>This is the first and most important command.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the second command is like the first: ‘Love your neighbor<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> your neighbor Or “others.” Jesus’ teaching in Luke 10:25-37 makes clear that this includes anyone in need.</span></a> the same as you love yourself.’<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Leviticus 19:18.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>All of the law and the writings of the prophets take their meaning from these two commands.” </div><div class='s'>Is the Messiah David’s Son <br/> or David’s Lord? </div><div class='r'>(Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>So while the Pharisees were together, Jesus asked them a question.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>He said, “What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?” </div><div class='p'>The Pharisees answered, “The Messiah is the Son of David.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “Then why did David call him ‘Lord’? David was speaking by the power of the Spirit. He said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>‘The Lord God said to my Lord: </div><div class='q'>Sit by me at my right side, </div><div class='q2'>and I will put your enemies under your control.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> control Literally, “feet.”</span></a>’ <span class='rq'><a href='PSA110.htm#V1'>Psalm 110:1</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>David calls the Messiah ‘Lord.’ So how can he be David’s son?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>None of the Pharisees could answer Jesus’ question. And after that day, no one was brave enough to ask him any more questions. </div><ul class='tnav'>
