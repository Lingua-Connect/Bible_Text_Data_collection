<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='s'>God Has Not Forgotten His People </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So I ask, “Did God force his people to leave him?” Of course not. I myself am an Israelite. I am from the family of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God chose the Israelites to be his people before they were born. And he did not force them to leave. Surely you know what the Scriptures say about Elijah. The Scriptures tell about Elijah praying to God against the people of Israel. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“Lord, they have killed your prophets and destroyed your altars. I am the only prophet still living, and they are trying to kill me now.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from 1 Kings 19:10, 14.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But what answer did God give to Elijah? God said, “I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have never given worship to Baal.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from 1 Kings 19:18.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>It is the same now. God has chosen a few people by his grace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And if he chose them by grace, then it is not what they have done that made them his people. If they could be made his people by what they did, his gift of grace would not really be a gift. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So this is what has happened: The people of Israel wanted God’s blessing, but they did not all get it. The people he chose did get his blessing, but the others became hard and refused to listen to him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>As the Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“God caused the people to fall asleep.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA29.htm#V10'>Isaiah 29:10</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“God closed their eyes so that they could not see, </div><div class='q2'>and he closed their ears so that they could not hear. </div><div class='q'>This continues until now.” <span class='rq'><a href='DEU29.htm#V4'>Deuteronomy 29:4</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And David says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Let those people be caught and trapped at their own feasts. </div><div class='q2'>Let them fall and be punished. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let their eyes be closed so that they cannot see. </div><div class='q2'>And let them be troubled forever.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA069.htm#V22'>Psalm 69:22-23</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So I ask: When the Jews fell, did that fall destroy them? No! But their mistake brought salvation to those who are not Jews. The purpose of this was to make the Jews jealous.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Their mistake brought rich blessings to the world. And what they lost brought rich blessings to the non-Jewish people. So surely the world will get much richer blessings when enough Jews become the kind of people God wants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now I am speaking to you people who are not Jews. I am an apostle to the non-Jewish people. So while I have that work, I will do the best I can.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I hope I can make my own people jealous. That way, maybe I can help some of them to be saved.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>God turned away from the Jews. When that happened, he became friends with the other people in the world. So when he accepts the Jews, it will be like bringing people to life after death.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If the first piece of bread is offered to God, then the whole loaf is made holy. If the roots of a tree are holy, the tree’s branches are holy too. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>It is as if some of the branches from an olive tree have been broken off, and the branch of a wild olive tree has been joined to that first tree. If you are not a Jew, you are the same as that wild branch, and you now share the strength and life of the first tree.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But don’t act as if you are better than those branches that were broken off. You have no reason to be proud of yourself, because you don’t give life to the root. The root gives life to you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You might say, “Branches were broken off so that I could be joined to their tree.”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>That is true. But those branches were broken off because they did not believe. And you continue to be part of the tree only because you believe. Don’t be proud, but be afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If God did not let the natural branches of that tree stay, he will not let you stay if you stop believing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So you see that God is kind, but he can also be very strict. He punishes those who stop following him. But he is kind to you, if you continue trusting in his kindness. If you don’t continue depending on him, you will be cut off from the tree.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And if the Jews will believe in God again, he will accept them back. He is able to put them back where they were.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>It is not natural for a wild branch to become part of a good tree. But you non-Jewish people are like a branch cut from a wild olive tree. And you were joined to a good olive tree. But those Jews are like a branch that grew from the good tree. So surely they can be joined to their own tree again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I want you to understand this secret truth, brothers and sisters. This truth will help you understand that you don’t know everything. The truth is this: Part of Israel has been made stubborn, but that will change when enough non-Jewish people have come to God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And that is how all Israel will be saved. The Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“The Savior will come from Zion; </div><div class='q2'>he will take away all evil from the family of Jacob. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I will make this agreement with those people </div><div class='q2'>when I take away their sins.” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA59.htm#V20'>Isaiah 59:20-21</a>; <a href='ISA27.htm#V9'>27:9</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The Jews refuse to accept the Good News, so they are God’s enemies. This has happened to help you who are not Jews. But they are still God’s chosen people, and he loves them because of the promises he made to their ancestors.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>God never changes his mind about the people he calls. He never decides to take back the blessings he has given them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>At one time you refused to obey God. But now you have received mercy, because the Jews refused to obey.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And now they are the ones who refuse to obey, because God showed mercy to you. But this happened so that they can also receive mercy from him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>All people have refused to obey God. And he has put them all together as people who don’t obey him so that he can show mercy to everyone. </div><div class='s'>Praise to God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Yes, God’s riches are very great! His wisdom and knowledge have no end! No one can explain what God decides. No one can understand his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>As the Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Who can know what is on the Lord’s mind? </div><div class='q2'>Who is able to give him advice?” <span class='rq'><a href='ISA40.htm#V13'>Isaiah 40:13</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>“Who has ever given God anything? </div><div class='q2'>God owes nothing to anyone.” <span class='rq'><a href='JOB41.htm#V11'>Job 41:11</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Yes, God made all things. And everything continues through him and for him. To God be the glory forever! Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
