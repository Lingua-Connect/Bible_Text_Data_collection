<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='s'>The Coming of the Holy Spirit </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Suddenly a noise came from heaven. It sounded like a strong wind blowing. This noise filled the whole house where they were sitting.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They saw something that looked like flames of fire. The flames were separated and stood over each person there.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak different languages. The Holy Spirit was giving them the power to do this. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There were some godly Jews in Jerusalem at this time. They were from every country in the world.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>A large crowd came together because they heard the noise. They were surprised because, as the apostles were speaking, everyone heard in their own language. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They were all amazed at this. They did not understand how the apostles could do this. They said, “Look! These men we hear speaking are all from Galilee.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> from Galilee The people thought men from Galilee could speak only their own language.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But we hear them in our own languages. How is this possible? We are from all these different places:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Parthia, Media, Elam, Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the areas of Libya near the city of Cyrene, Rome,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Crete, and Arabia. Some of us were born Jews, and others have changed their religion to worship God like Jews. We are from these different countries, but we can hear these men in our own languages! We can all understand the great things they are saying about God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The people were all amazed and confused. They asked each other, “What is happening?”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But others were laughing at the apostles, saying they were drunk from too much wine. </div><div class='s'>Peter Speaks to the People </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Peter stood up with the other eleven apostles. He spoke loudly so that all the people could hear. He said, “My Jewish brothers and all of you who live in Jerusalem, listen to me. I will tell you something you need to know. Listen carefully.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>These men are not drunk as you think; it’s only nine o’clock in the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Joel the prophet wrote about what you see happening here today. This is what he wrote: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>‘God says: In the last days </div><div class='q2'>I will pour out my Spirit on all people. </div><div class='q'>Your sons and daughters will prophesy. </div><div class='q2'>Your young men will see visions. </div><div class='q2'>Your old men will have special dreams. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>In those days I will pour out my Spirit </div><div class='q2'>on my servants, men and women, </div><div class='q2'>and they will prophesy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I will work wonders in the sky above. </div><div class='q2'>I will cause miraculous signs on the earth below. </div><div class='q2'>There will be blood, fire, and thick smoke. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The sun will be changed into darkness, </div><div class='q2'>and the moon will be as red as blood. </div><div class='q2'>Then the great and glorious day of the Lord will come. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And everyone who trusts in the Lord<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> who trusts in the Lord Literally, “who calls on the name of the Lord,” meaning to show faith in him by worshiping him or praying to him for help.</span></a> will be saved.’ <span class='rq'><a href='JOL02.htm#V28'>Joel 2:28-32</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“My fellow Israelites, listen to these words: Jesus from Nazareth was a very special man. God clearly showed this to you. He proved it by the miracles, wonders, and miraculous signs he did through Jesus. You all saw these things, so you know this is true.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Jesus was handed over to you, and you killed him. With the help of evil men, you nailed him to a cross. But God knew all this would happen. It was his plan—a plan he made long ago.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jesus suffered the pain of death, but God made him free. He raised him from death. There was no way for death to hold him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>David said this about him: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘I saw the Lord before me always; </div><div class='q2'>he is at my right side to keep me safe. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So my heart is happy, </div><div class='q2'>and the words I speak are words of joy. </div><div class='q2'>Yes, even my body will live with hope, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>because you will not leave me in the place of death.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> place of death Literally, “Hades.” Also in verse 31.</span></a> </div><div class='q2'>You will not let the body of your Holy One rot in the grave. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>You taught me how to live. </div><div class='q2'>You will come close to me and give me great joy.’ <span class='rq'><a href='PSA016.htm#V8'>Psalm 16:8-11</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>“My brothers, I can tell you for sure about David, our great ancestor. He died, was buried, and his tomb is still here with us today.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He was a prophet and knew something that God had said. God had promised David that someone from his own family would sit on David’s throne as king.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> God had promised … as king See 2 Sam. 7:12, 13 and Psalm 132:11.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>David knew this before it happened. That is why he said this about that future king: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘He was not left in the place of death. </div><div class='q2'>His body did not rot in the grave.’ </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>David was talking about the Messiah rising from death.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So Jesus is the one God raised from death. We are all witnesses of this. We saw him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jesus was lifted up to heaven. Now he is with God, at God’s right side. The Father has given the Holy Spirit to him, as he promised. So Jesus has now poured out that Spirit. This is what you see and hear.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>David was not the one who was lifted up to heaven.

They asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Peter said to them, “Change your hearts and lives and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ.
