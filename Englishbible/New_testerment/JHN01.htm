You say you are not Elijah or the Prophet. Then why do you baptize people?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>John answered, “I baptize people with water. But there is someone here with you that you don’t know.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He is the one who is coming later. I am not good enough to be the slave who unties the strings on his sandals.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>These things all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River. This is where John was baptizing people. </div><div class='s'>Jesus, the Lamb of God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God. He takes away the sins of the world!  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>This is the one I was talking about when I said, ‘There is a man coming after me who is greater than I am, because he was living even before I was born.’  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>I did not know who he was.

But the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘You will see the Spirit come down and rest on a man. He is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen this happen. I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on this man.

One of them was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The first thing Andrew did was to go and find his brother Simon. Andrew said to him, “We have found the Messiah.” (“Messiah” means “Christ.”) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Then Andrew brought Simon to Jesus.
