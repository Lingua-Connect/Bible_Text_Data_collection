<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Don’t speak angrily to an older man. But talk to him as if he were your father. Treat the younger men like brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Treat the older women like mothers. And treat the younger women with respect like sisters. </div><div class='s'>Taking Care of Widows </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Take care of widows who really need help.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, the first thing they need to learn is this: to show their devotion to God by taking care of their own family. They will be repaying their parents, and this pleases God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>A widow who really needs help is one who has been left all alone. She trusts God to take care of her. She prays all the time, night and day, and asks God for help.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But the widow who uses her life to please herself is really dead while she is still living.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Tell the believers there to take care of their family so that no one can say they are doing wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Everyone should take care of all their own people. Most important, they should take care of their own family. If they do not do that, then they do not accept what we believe. They are worse than someone who does not even believe in God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>To be added to your list of widows, a woman must be 60 years old or older. She must have been faithful to her husband.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> faithful to her husband Literally, “a woman of one man.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>She must be known for the good she has done: raising children, welcoming travelers into her home, serving the needs<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> serving the needs Literally, “washing the feet,” a social custom of the first century, because people wore open sandals on very dusty roads.</span></a> of God’s people, helping those in trouble, and using her life to do all kinds of good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But don’t put younger widows on that list. When their strong physical needs pull them away from their commitment to Christ, they will want to marry again.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then they will be guilty of not doing what they first promised to do.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Also, these younger widows begin to waste their time going from house to house. They also begin to gossip and try to run other people’s lives. They say things they should not say.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So I want the younger widows to marry, have children, and take care of their homes. If they do this, our enemy will not have any reason to criticize them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But some of the younger widows have already turned away to follow Satan. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> woman … she Some Greek copies have “man or woman … he/she.”</span></a> should take care of them herself. Then the church will not have that burden and will be able to care for the widows who have no one else to help them. </div><div class='s'>More About Elders and Other Matters </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The elders who lead the church in a good way should receive double honor<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> double honor Or “double pay.”</span></a>—in particular, those who do the work of counseling and teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As the Scriptures say, “When a work animal is being used to separate grain, don’t keep it from eating the grain.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deuteronomy 25:4.</span></a> And the Scriptures also say, “A worker should be given his pay.”<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Luke 10:7.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Don’t listen to someone who accuses an elder. You should listen to them only if there are two or three others who can say what the elder did wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Tell those who sin that they are wrong. Do this in front of the whole church so that the others will have a warning. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Before God and Jesus Christ and the chosen angels, I tell you to make these judgments without any prejudice. Treat every person the same. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Think carefully before you lay your hands on anyone to make him an elder. Don’t share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Timothy, stop drinking only water, and drink a little wine. This will help your stomach, and you will not be sick so often. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The sins of some people are easy to see. Their sins show that they will be judged. But the sins of some others are seen only later.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>It is the same with the good things people do. Some are easy to see. But even if they are not obvious now, none of them will stay hidden forever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
