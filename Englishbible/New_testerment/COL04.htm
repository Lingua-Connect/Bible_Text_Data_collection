Remember that you have a Master in heaven. </div><div class='s'>Some Things to Do </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Never stop praying. Be ready for anything by praying and being thankful.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Also pray for us. Pray that God will give us an opportunity to tell people his message. I am in prison for doing this. But pray that we can continue to tell people the secret truth that God has made known about Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Pray that I will say what is necessary to make this truth clear to everyone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Be wise in the way you act with those who are not believers. Use your time in the best way you can.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When you talk, you should always be kind and wise. Then you will be able to answer everyone in the way you should. </div><div class='s'>News About Those With Paul </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Tychicus is my dear brother in Christ.

I want you to know how we are, and I am sending him to encourage you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I am sending him with Onesimus, the faithful and dear brother from your group.

Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, also sends his greetings. (I have already told you what to do about Mark. If he comes, welcome him.)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And greetings from Jesus, the one who is also called Justus. These are the only Jewish believers who work with me for God’s kingdom. They have been a great comfort to me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Epaphras, another servant of Jesus Christ from your group, sends his greetings. He constantly struggles for you in prayer.
