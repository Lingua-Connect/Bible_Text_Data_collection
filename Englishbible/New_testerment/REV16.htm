<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='s'>The Bowls Filled With God’s Anger </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then I heard a loud voice from the temple. It said to the seven angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of God’s anger on the earth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The first angel left. He poured out his bowl on the land. Then all those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its idol got sores that were ugly and painful. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea. Then the sea became blood like a dead man’s blood. And everything living in the sea died. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water. The rivers and the springs of water became blood.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then I heard the angel of the waters say to God, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“You are the one who is and who always was. </div><div class='q2'>You are the Holy One. </div><div class='q2'>You are right in these judgments you have made. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The people have spilled the blood </div><div class='q2'>of your holy people and your prophets. </div><div class='q'>Now you have given those people blood to drink. </div><div class='q2'>This is what they deserve.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I heard the altar say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Yes, Lord God All-Powerful, </div><div class='q2'>your judgments are true and right.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun. The sun was given power to burn the people with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The people were burned by the great heat. They cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues. But they refused to change their hearts and lives and give glory to God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast. And darkness covered the beast’s kingdom. People bit their tongues because of the pain.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They cursed the God of heaven because of their pain and the sores they had. But they refused to change their hearts and turn away from the evil things they did. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates. The water in the river was dried up. This prepared the way for the rulers from the east to come.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs. They came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>These evil spirits are the spirits of demons. They have power to do miracles.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> miracles False miracles—amazing acts done by the power of the devil.</span></a> They go out to the rulers of the whole world to gather them for battle on the great day of God All-Powerful. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“Listen! I will come at a time you don’t expect, like a thief. Great blessings belong to those who stay awake and keep their clothes with them. They will not have to go without clothes and be ashamed for people to see them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then the evil spirits gathered the rulers together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. Then a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne. It said, “It is finished!”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then there were flashes of lightning, noises, thunder, and a big earthquake. This was the worst earthquake that has ever happened since people have been on earth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The great city split into three parts. The cities of the nations were destroyed. And God did not forget to punish Babylon the Great. He gave that city the cup filled with the wine of his terrible anger.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Every island disappeared and there were no more mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Giant hailstones fell on the people from the sky. These hailstones weighed almost 100 pounds<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 100 pounds Literally, “<span class='tl'>talanton</span>” or “talent.” A talent was about 27 to 36 kg (60 to 80 pounds).</span></a> each.
