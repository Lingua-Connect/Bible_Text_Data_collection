<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='s'>Wise Men Come to Visit Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in Judea during the time when Herod was king. After Jesus was born, some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They asked people, “Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? We saw the star that shows he was born. We saw it rise in the sky in the east and have come to worship him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When King Herod heard about this, it upset him as well as everyone else in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Herod called a meeting of all the leading Jewish priests and teachers of the law. He asked them where the Messiah would be born.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They answered, “In the town of Bethlehem in Judea, just as the prophet wrote: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>‘Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, </div><div class='q2'>you are important among the rulers of Judah. </div><div class='q'>Yes, a ruler will come from you, </div><div class='q2'>and that ruler will lead Israel, my people.’ ” <span class='rq'><a href='MIC05.htm#V2'>Micah 5:2</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Herod had a private meeting with the wise men from the east. He learned from them the exact time they first saw the star.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he sent them to Bethlehem. He said, “Go and look carefully for the child. When you find him, come tell me. Then I can go worship him too.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>After the wise men heard the king, they left. They saw the same star they had seen in the east, and they followed it. The star went before them until it stopped above the place where the child was.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They were very happy and excited to see the star. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The wise men came to the house where the child was with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened the boxes of gifts they had brought for him. They gave him treasures of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But God warned the wise men in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they went home to their own country a different way. </div><div class='s'>Jesus’ Parents Take Him to Egypt </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>After the wise men left, an angel from the Lord came to Joseph in a dream. The angel said, “Get up! Take the child with his mother and escape to Egypt. Herod wants to kill the child and will soon start looking for him. Stay in Egypt until I tell you to come back.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Joseph got ready and left for Egypt with the child and the mother. They left during the night.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Joseph stayed in Egypt until Herod died. This gave full meaning to what the Lord said through the prophet: “I called my son to come out of Egypt.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Hosea 11:1.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Herod Kills the Baby Boys in Bethlehem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Herod saw that the wise men had fooled him, and he was very angry. So he gave an order to kill all the baby boys in Bethlehem and the whole area around Bethlehem. Herod had learned from the wise men the time the baby was born. It was now two years from that time. So he said to kill all the boys who were two years old and younger.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This gave full meaning to what God said through the prophet Jeremiah: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“A sound was heard in Ramah— </div><div class='q2'>bitter crying and great sadness. </div><div class='q'>Rachel cries for her children, </div><div class='q2'>and she cannot be comforted, </div><div class='q2'>because her children are gone.” <span class='rq'><a href='JER31.htm#V15'>Jeremiah 31:15</a></span> </div><div class='s'>Joseph and Mary Return From Egypt </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>While Joseph was in Egypt, Herod died. An angel from the Lord came to Joseph in a dream  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and said, “Get up! Take the child with his mother and go to Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are now dead.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So Joseph took the child and the mother and went to Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But he heard that Archelaus was now king in Judea. Archelaus became king when his father Herod died. So Joseph was afraid to go there. Then, after being warned in a dream, he went away to the area of Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He went to a town called Nazareth and lived there. This gave full meaning to what God said through the prophets. God said the Messiah<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> the Messiah Literally, “he.” See “Messiah” in the Word List.</span></a> would be called a Nazarene.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Nazarene A person from the city of Nazareth. This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “branch.” So Matthew may be referring to the promise of a “branch” of David’s family. See Isaiah 11:1.</span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
