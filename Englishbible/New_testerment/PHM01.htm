</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Greetings from Paul, a prisoner for Jesus Christ, and from Timothy, our brother. </div><div class='p'>To Philemon, our dear friend and worker with us.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Also to our sister Apphia, to Archippus, who serves with us in the Lord’s army, and to the church that meets in your home. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class='s'>Philemon’s Love and Faith </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I remember you in my prayers. And I always thank my God for you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I thank God because I hear about the love you have for all of God’s holy people and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I pray that the faith you share will make you understand every blessing we have in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>My brother, you have shown love to God’s people, and your help has greatly encouraged them. What a great joy and encouragement that has been to me. </div><div class='s'>Accept Onesimus as a Brother </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>There is something that you should do. And because of the authority I have in Christ, I feel free to command you to do it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But I am not commanding you; I am asking you to do it out of love. I, Paul, am an old man now, and I am a prisoner for Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I am asking you for my son Onesimus. He became my son while I was in prison.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In the past he was useless to you. But now he has become useful<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> useless … useful Paul here makes a play on words with the name Onesimus, which means “useful.”</span></a> for both you and me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I am sending him back to you, but it’s as hard as losing part of myself.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I would like to keep him here to help me while I am still in prison for telling the Good News. By helping me here, he would be representing you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I did not want to do anything without asking you first. Then whatever you do for me will be what you want to do, not what I forced you to do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Onesimus was separated from you for a short time. Maybe that happened so that you could have him back forever,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>not to be just a slave, but better than a slave, to be a dear brother. That’s what he is to me. And I know he will mean even more to you, both as your slave and as one who shares your faith in the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If you accept me as your friend, then accept Onesimus back. Welcome him like you would welcome me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If he has done any wrong to you or owes you anything, charge that to me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I, Paul, am writing this in my own handwriting: I will pay back anything Onesimus owes. And I will say nothing about what you owe me for your own life.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So, my brother, as a follower of the Lord please do this favor<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> please do this favor Paul here makes another wordplay on the name Onesimus, using a verb related to it.</span></a> for me. It would be such a great encouragement to me as your brother in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I write this letter knowing that you will do what I ask, and even more than I ask. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Also, please prepare a room for me. I hope that God will answer your prayers and that I will be able to come and see you. </div><div class='s'>Final Greetings </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Epaphras is a prisoner with me for Christ Jesus. He sends you his greetings.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Also Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke send their greetings. They are workers together with me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </div><ul class='tnav'>
