It is not yet time for me to begin my work.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>His mother said to the servants, “Do what he tells you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>There were six large stone waterpots there that were used by the Jews in their washing ceremonies.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> washing ceremonies The Jews had religious rules about washing in special ways before eating, before worshiping in the Temple, and at other special times.</span></a> Each one held about 20 or 30 gallons.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 20 or 30 gallons Literally, “2 or 3 <span class='tl'>metretas</span>,” about 80 to 120 liters.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them to the top. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he said to them, “Now dip out some water and take it to the man in charge of the feast.” </div><div class='p'>So they did what he said.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the man in charge tasted it, but the water had become wine. He did not know where the wine had come from, but the servants who brought the water knew. He called the bridegroom  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and said to him, “People always serve the best wine first. Later, when the guests are drunk, they serve the cheaper wine. But you have saved the best wine until now.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This was the first of all the miraculous signs Jesus did. He did it in the town of Cana in Galilee. By this he showed his divine greatness, and his followers believed in him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Jesus went to the town of Capernaum. His mother and brothers and his followers went with him. They all stayed there a few days. </div><div class='s'>Jesus at the Temple </div><div class='r'>(Matthew 21:12-13; Mark 11:15-17; Luke 19:45-46) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>It was almost time for the Jewish Passover, so Jesus went to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>There in the Temple area he saw men selling cattle, sheep, and doves. He saw others sitting at tables, exchanging and trading people’s money.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Jesus made a whip with some pieces of rope. Then he forced all these men and the sheep and cattle to leave the Temple area. He turned over the tables of the money traders and scattered their money.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then he said to those who were selling pigeons, “Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a place for buying and selling!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When this happened, his followers remembered what was written in the Scriptures: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“My strong devotion to your Temple will destroy me.” <span class='rq'><a href='PSA069.htm#V9'>Psalm 69:9</a></span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Some Jews said to Jesus, “Show us a miracle as a sign from God. Prove that you have the right to do these things.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple and I will build it again in three days.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They answered, “People worked 46 years to build this Temple! Do you really believe you can build it again in three days?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the temple Jesus meant was his own body.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>After he was raised from death, his followers remembered that he had said this. So they believed the Scriptures, and they believed the words Jesus said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover festival. Many people believed in him because they saw the miraculous signs he did.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But Jesus did not trust them, because he knew how all people think.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He did not need anyone to tell him what a person was like. He already knew. </div><ul class='tnav'>
