<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='s'>Amnon and Tamar </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>David had a son named Absalom. Absalom had a very beautiful sister named Tamar. Another one of David’s sons, Amnon,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Amnon Amnon was half-brother to Absalom and Tamar. They all had David as their father, but Amnon had a different mother. See 2 Sam. 3:2, 3.</span></a> was in love with Tamar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>She was a virgin. Amnon wanted her very much, but he did not think it was possible for him to have her. He thought about her so much that he made himself sick.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> He thought … sick Or “Amnon thought of a plan to pretend he was sick.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah. (Shimeah was David’s brother.) Jonadab was a very clever man.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He said to Amnon, “You are the king’s son. So why do you always look so sad? Tell me what the trouble is!” </div><div class='p'>Amnon told Jonadab, “I love Tamar. But she is the sister of my half-brother Absalom.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jonadab said to Amnon, “Go to bed. Pretend you are sick. Then your father will come to see you. Tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come in and give me food to eat. Let her make the food in front of me. Then I will see it and eat it from her hand.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Amnon lay down in bed and pretended to be sick. King David came in to see Amnon. He said to King David, “Please let my sister Tamar come in. Let her make two cakes for me while I watch. Then I can eat from her hands.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>David sent messengers to Tamar’s house. They told her, “Go to your brother Amnon’s house and make some food for him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon. He was in bed. Tamar took some dough, pressed it together with her hands, and cooked the cakes. She did this while he watched.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Tamar took the cakes out of the pan and set them out for him. But he refused to eat. He said to his servants, “Get out of here. Leave me alone!” So all of his servants left the room. </div><div class='s'>Amnon Rapes Tamar </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom and feed me by hand.” </div><div class='p'>So Tamar took the cakes she had made and went into her brother’s bedroom.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>She started to feed Amnon, but he grabbed her hand. He said to her, “Sister, come and sleep with me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Tamar said to Amnon, “No, brother! Don’t force me to do this. Don’t do this shameful thing! Terrible things like this should never be done in Israel!  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I would never get rid of my shame, and people would think that you are just a common criminal. Please, talk with the king. He will let you marry me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Amnon refused to listen to Tamar. He was stronger than she was, so he forced her to have sexual relations with him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Amnon began to hate Tamar. He hated her much more than he had loved her before. Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out of here!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Tamar said to Amnon, “No! Don’t send me away like this. That would be even worse than what you did before!” </div><div class='p'>But Amnon refused to listen to Tamar.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He called his servant and said, “Get this girl out of this room, now! And lock the door after her.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So Amnon’s servant led Tamar out of the room and locked the door. </div><div class='p'>Tamar was wearing a long robe with many colors.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> many colors Or “stripes.”</span></a> The king’s virgin daughters wore robes like this.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Tamar tore her robe of many colors and put ashes on her head. Then she put her hand on her head and began crying.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Tamar tore … crying This was the way people showed how very sad and upset they were.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Tamar’s brother Absalom said to her, “Have you been with your brother Amnon? Did he hurt you? Now, calm down sister. Amnon is your brother, <span class='add'>so we will take care of this</span>. Don’t let it upset you too much.” So Tamar did not say anything. She quietly went to live at Absalom’s house.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> She … Absalom’s house Or “She lived in her brother Absalom’s house, a ruined woman.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>King David heard the news and became very angry, but he did not want to say anything to upset Amnon, because he loved him since he was his firstborn son.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> but he did not … son This is found in the ancient Greek version and a Hebrew scroll from Qumran but not in the standard Hebrew text.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Absalom began to hate Amnon. Absalom did not say one word, good or bad, to Amnon, but he hated him because Amnon had raped his sister Tamar. </div><div class='s'>Absalom’s Revenge </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Two years later, Absalom had some men come to Baal Hazor to cut the wool from his sheep. He invited all the king’s sons to come and watch.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Absalom went to the king and said, “I have some men coming to cut the wool from my sheep. Please come with your servants and watch.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>King David said to Absalom, “No, son. We will not all go. It will be too much trouble for you.” </div><div class='p'>Absalom begged David to go. David did not go, but he did give his blessing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Absalom said, “If you don’t want to go, please let my brother Amnon go with me.” </div><div class='p'>King David asked Absalom, “Why should he go with you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Absalom kept begging David. Finally, David let Amnon and all the king’s other sons go with Absalom. </div><div class='s'>Amnon Is Murdered </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Absalom gave this command to his servants, “Watch Amnon. When he is drunk and feeling good from the wine, I will give you the command. You must attack Amnon and kill him. Don’t be afraid of being punished. After all, you will only be obeying my command. Now, be strong and brave.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So Absalom’s young soldiers did what he said. They killed Amnon. But all of David’s other sons escaped. Each son got on his mule and escaped. </div><div class='s'>David Hears About Amnon’s Death </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The king’s sons were still on their way into town. But King David got a message about what happened. But the message was, “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons! Not one of the sons was left alive.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>King David tore his clothes and lay on the ground.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> tore his clothes … ground This showed that he was very sad and upset.</span></a> All of David’s officers standing near him also tore their clothes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But then Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, said, “Don’t think that all the king’s sons were killed! Only Amnon is dead. Absalom has been planning this from the day that Amnon raped his sister Tamar.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>My lord and king, don’t think that all of your sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Absalom ran away. </div><div class='p'>There was a guard standing on the city wall. He saw many people coming from the other side of the hill, and went to tell the king.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So Jonadab said to King David, “Look, I was right! The king’s sons are coming.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The king’s sons came in just after Jonadab said that. They were crying loudly. David and all of his officers began crying. They all cried very hard.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>David cried for his son every day. </div><div class='s'>Absalom Escapes to Geshur </div><div class='p'>Absalom ran away to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Talmai … king of Geshur Talmai was Absalom’s grandfather. See 2 Sam. 3:3.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>After Absalom had run away to Geshur, he stayed there for three years.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>King David was comforted after Amnon died, but he missed Absalom very much. </div><ul class='tnav'>
