<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='s'>Boaz and Naomi’s Close Relative </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Boaz went to the place where people gather near the city gates. He sat there until the close relative he had told Ruth about passed by. Boaz called to him, “Come and sit here, friend.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Boaz also gathered ten of the elders of the city. He told them, “Sit here!” So they sat down. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Boaz spoke to Naomi’s close relative. He said, “Naomi came back from the hill country of Moab. She wants to sell the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I decided to tell you about this in front of the people living here and in front of the elders of our people. If you want to pay the widow for the land and keep it in the family, then pay her for it. If you don’t want to buy the land, tell me, because I am the next one in the family who has the right to buy it. If you don’t buy the land from her, I will.” </div><div class='p'>Naomi’s closest relative said, “I will buy the land from her.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Boaz said, “If you buy the land from her, you must also marry the dead man’s wife, Ruth, the Moabite woman. Then the first child will get the land, and it will stay in the dead man’s family.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The close relative answered, “Then I cannot buy the land. If I do, I might lose my own land. So I cannot do it. You buy the land.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then he gave Boaz something to show that he was serious. During that time in Israel, when people bought property, one person took off a sandal and gave it to the other person. This was like signing an agreement.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So when the close relative said to Boaz, “You buy the land,” he took off his sandal and gave it to Boaz.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> and gave it to Boaz This is from the ancient Greek version.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I also take Ruth to be my wife. Then the dead man’s property will continue to belong to his family. And he will always be remembered by his family and the people in his hometown. You are all witnesses of what I am doing today.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So all the elders and the people who were near the city gates said, “We are witnesses to all of this. And may the LORD bless this woman who is coming into your home to be like Rachel and Leah. They are the ones who had many children to make the people of Israel strong. And may you become powerful in the tribe of Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem!  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>May the LORD bless you with many children through Ruth. May your family become great like the family of Perez,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Perez One of Boaz’s ancestors.</span></a> the son Tamar bore for Judah.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So Boaz married Ruth. The LORD allowed Ruth to become pregnant, and she had a son.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The women there said to Naomi, “Praise the LORD who gave you this child.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> child Literally, “protector” or “redeemer.” This might refer to Boaz, or the women might have used this name for the baby because he would be the one to care for Naomi and her family and to carry on the name of Elimelech.</span></a> May he become famous in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He will make you alive again and care for you in your old age. Your daughter-in-law made it happen because she bore this child for you. She loves you, and she is better for you than seven sons.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Naomi took the boy, held him in her arms, and cared for him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The neighbors gave the boy his name. These women said, “Naomi has a son now!”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Naomi … now Literally, “A son was born for Naomi.”</span></a> They named him Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David. </div><div class='s'>The Family of Ruth and Boaz </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>This is the family history of Perez: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'>Perez was the father of Hezron. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Hezron was the father of Ram. </div><div class='li'>Ram was the father of Amminadab. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. </div><div class='li'>Nahshon was the father of Salmon. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Salmon was the father of Boaz. </div><div class='li'>Boaz was the father of Obed. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Obed was the father of Jesse. </div><div class='li'>Jesse was the father of David. </div><ul class='tnav'>
