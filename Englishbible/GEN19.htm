<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div><div class='s'>Lot’s Visitors </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1-2&#160;</span>That evening the two angels came to the city of Sodom. Lot was sitting near the city gates and saw them. He got up and went to them. He bowed to show respect and said, “Sirs, please come to my house, and I will serve you. There you can wash your feet and stay the night. Then tomorrow you can continue your journey.” </div><div class='p'>The angels answered, “No, we will stay the night in the city square.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But Lot continued to ask them to come to his house, so they agreed and went with him. Lot gave them something to drink. He baked some bread for them, and they ate it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>That evening, just before bedtime, men from every part of town came to Lot’s house. They stood around the house and called to Lot. They said,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Where are the two men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us. We want to have sex with them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Lot went outside and closed the door behind him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He said to the men, “No, my friends, I beg you, please don’t do this evil thing!  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man before. I will give my daughters to you. You can do anything you want with them. But please don’t do anything to these men. They have come to my house, and I must protect them.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> I must protect them Whoever invited a traveler in as a guest was also promising to protect the traveler.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The men surrounding the house answered, “Get out of our way!” They said to themselves, “This man Lot came to our city as a visitor. Now he wants to tell us how we should live!” Then the men said to Lot, “We will do worse things to you than to them.” So the men started moving closer and closer to Lot. They were about to break down the door. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But the two men staying with Lot opened the door, pulled him back inside the house, and closed the door.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then they did something to the men outside the door—they caused all these evil men, young and old, to become blind. So the men trying to get in the house could not find the door. </div><div class='s'>The Escape From Sodom </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The two men said to Lot, “Are there any other people from your family living in this city? Do you have any sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or any other people from your family here? If so, you should tell them to leave now.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>We are going to destroy this city. The LORD heard how evil this city is, so he sent us to destroy it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, the men who had married his other daughters. He said, “Hurry and leave this city! The LORD will soon destroy it!” But they thought he was joking. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The next morning at dawn, the angels were trying to make Lot hurry. They said, “This city will be punished, so take your wife and your two daughters who are still with you and leave this place. Then you will not be destroyed with the city.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When Lot did not move fast enough, the two men grabbed his hand. They also took the hands of his wife and his two daughters. The two men led Lot and his family safely out of the city. The LORD was kind to Lot and his family.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So after the two men brought Lot and his family out of the city, one of the men said, “Now run to save your life! Don’t look back at the city, and don’t stop anywhere in the valley. Run until you are in the mountains. If you stop, you will be destroyed with the city!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Lot said to the two men, “Sirs, please don’t force me to run so far!  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You have been very kind to me, your servant. You have been very kind to save me, but I cannot run all the way to the mountains. What if I am too slow and something happens? I will be killed!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Look, there is a very small town near here. Let me run to that town. I can run there and be safe.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The angel said to Lot, “Very well, I’ll let you do that. I will not destroy that town.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But run there quickly. I cannot destroy Sodom until you are safely in that town.” (That town is named Zoar,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Zoar This name means “small.”</span></a> because it is a small town.) </div><div class='s'>Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Lot was entering the town as the sun came up,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and the LORD began to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. He caused fire and burning sulfur to fall from the sky.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He destroyed the whole valley—all the cities, the people living in the cities, and all the plants in the valley. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Lot’s wife was following behind him and looked back at the city. When she did, she became a block of salt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Early the next morning, Abraham got up and went to the place where he stood before the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Abraham looked down into the valley toward the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. He saw clouds of smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>God destroyed the cities in the valley, but he remembered what Abraham had said. So God sent Lot away from those cities before destroying them. </div><div class='s'>Lot and His Daughters </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar, so he and his two daughters went to live in the mountains in a cave.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Everywhere on the earth, men and women marry and have a family. But our father is old, and there are no men around here to give us children.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So let’s get our father drunk with wine. Then we can have sex with him. That way we can use our father to keep our family alive!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>That night the two girls went to their father and got him drunk with wine. Then the older daughter went and had sexual relations with him. He did not even know when she came to bed or when she got up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The next day the older daughter said to the younger daughter, “Last night I went to bed with my father. Let’s get him drunk with wine again tonight. Then you can go and have sex with him. In this way we can use our father to have children, and our family will not come to an end.”  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So that night the two girls got their father drunk with wine. Then the younger daughter went and had sexual relations with him. Again, Lot did not know when she came to bed or when she got up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant. Their father was the father of their babies.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The older daughter gave birth to a son. She named him Moab.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Moab In Hebrew this name sounds like “from father.”</span></a> Moab is the ancestor of all the Moabites living today.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>The younger daughter also gave birth to a son. She named him Ben-Ammi.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Ben-Ammi In Hebrew this name sounds like “son of my father” or “son of my people.”</span></a> Ben-Ammi is the ancestor of all the Ammonites living today. </div><ul class='tnav'>
