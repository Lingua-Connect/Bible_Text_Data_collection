<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 36</div><div class='s'>The Land of Zelophehad’s Daughters </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Manasseh was Joseph’s son. Makir was Manasseh’s son. Gilead was Makir’s son. The leaders of Gilead’s family went to talk to Moses and the leaders of tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They said, “Sir, the LORD commanded us to get our land by throwing lots. And sir, the LORD commanded that the land of Zelophehad our brother be given to his daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Maybe a man from one of the other tribes will marry one of Zelophehad’s daughters. Will that land leave our family? Will the people of that other tribe get the land? Will we lose the land that we got by throwing lots?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>People might sell their land, but in the Jubilee year, all the land is returned to the tribe that really owns it. At that time who will get the land that belongs to Zelophehad’s daughters? Will our tribe lose that land forever?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moses gave this command from the LORD to the Israelites: “These men from the tribe of Joseph are right.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>This is the LORD’S command to Zelophehad’s daughters: If you want to marry someone, you must marry someone from your own tribe.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In this way land will not be passed from tribe to tribe among the Israelites. Each Israelite will keep the land that belonged to their own ancestors.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And if a woman gets her father’s land, she must marry someone from her own tribe. That way everyone will keep the land that belonged to his ancestors.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So the land must not be passed from tribe to tribe among the Israelites. Each Israelite will keep the land that belonged to their own ancestors.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So Zelophehad’s daughters obeyed the LORD’S command to Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah—married their cousins on their father’s side of the family.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Their husbands were from Manasseh’s family groups, so their land remained within their father’s family group and tribe. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So these are the laws and commands that the LORD gave to Moses in the Jordan Valley in Moab by the Jordan River, across from Jericho. </div><ul class='tnav'>
