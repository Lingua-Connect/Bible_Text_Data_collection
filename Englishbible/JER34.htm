<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 34</div><div class='s'>A Warning to Zedekiah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The message from the LORD came to Jeremiah. The message came at the time when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and all the towns around it. Nebuchadnezzar had with him all his army and the armies of all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>This was the message: “This is what the LORD, the God of the people of Israel, says: Jeremiah, go to King Zedekiah of Judah and give him this message: ‘Zedekiah, this is what the LORD says: I will give the city of Jerusalem to the king of Babylon very soon, and he will burn it down.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Zedekiah, you will not escape from the king of Babylon. You will surely be caught and given to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes. He will talk to you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But listen to the promise of the LORD, King Zedekiah of Judah. This is what the LORD says about you: You will not be killed with a sword.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You will die in a peaceful way. People made funeral fires to honor your ancestors, the kings who ruled before you became king. In the same way people will make a funeral fire to honor you. They will cry for you and sadly say, “Oh, my master!” I myself make this promise to you.’ ” This message is from the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Jeremiah told all this message to Zedekiah in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>This was while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem. The army of Babylon was also fighting against the cities of Judah that had not been captured. These cities were Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in the land of Judah. </div><div class='s'>The People Break an Agreement </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>King Zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in Jerusalem to give freedom to all the Hebrew slaves. A message from the LORD came to Jeremiah after Zedekiah had made that agreement.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Everyone was supposed to free their Hebrew slaves. All male and female Hebrew slaves were to be set free. No one was supposed to keep another person from the tribe of Judah in slavery.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So all the leaders of Judah and all the people accepted this agreement. They would free their male and female slaves so that they would no longer serve them. Everyone agreed, and so all the slaves were set free.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But after that,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> after that In the summer of 588 B.C., the Egyptian army came to help the people of Jerusalem. So the Babylonian army had to leave Jerusalem for a short time to fight the Egyptians. The people of Jerusalem thought God had helped them, and things were back to normal, so they didn’t keep their promise. They took the slaves they had set free back into slavery.</span></a> the people who had slaves changed their minds. So they took the people they had set free and made them slaves again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then this message from the LORD came to Jeremiah:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“This is what the LORD, the God of the people of Israel, says: ‘I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, where they were slaves. When I did that, I made an agreement with them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I said to your ancestors, “At the end of every seven years, everyone must set their Hebrew slaves free. If you have fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you, you must let them go free after they have served you for six years.” But your ancestors did not listen to me or pay attention to me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>A short time ago you changed your hearts to do what is right. Everyone set free their fellow Hebrews who were slaves. And you even made an agreement before me in the Temple that is called by my name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But now you have changed your minds. You have shown that you do not honor my name because each of you has taken back the male and female slaves that you had set free. You have forced them to become slaves again.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“So this is what the LORD says: ‘You people have not obeyed me. You have not given freedom to your fellow Hebrews. So, because you have not given them freedom, I will give a special kind of freedom—freedom to die in war or by disease or by hunger! This message is from the LORD. When the other nations see what I have done to you, they will all be shocked.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I will hand over those who broke my agreement and have not kept the promises they made before me. They cut a calf into two pieces before me and walked between the two pieces.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> They … two pieces This is part of a ceremony people used when they made an important agreement. An animal was cut into two pieces. Those who were making the agreement would walk between the pieces. Then they would say something like, “May this same thing happen to me if I don’t keep the agreement.” See Genesis 15.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>These are the people who walked between the two pieces of the calf when they made the agreement before me: the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the important officials of the court, the priests, and the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So I will give them to their enemies and to everyone who wants to kill them. Their bodies will become food for the birds of the air and for the wild animals of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I will give King Zedekiah of Judah and his leaders to their enemies and to everyone who wants to kill them. I will give Zedekiah and his people to the army of the king of Babylon, even though that army has left Jerusalem.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> left Jerusalem In the summer of 588 B.C., the Egyptian army came to help the people of Jerusalem.
