<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='s'>Dedicating the Holy Tent </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Moses finished setting up the Holy Tent. On that day he dedicated it to God. Moses anointed the Tent and everything in it. He also anointed the altar and all the things used with it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then the leaders of Israel gave offerings to God. These men were the heads of their families and leaders of their tribes. These were the same men who were in charge of counting the people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>These leaders brought gifts and gave them to the LORD in front of the Holy Tent. They brought six covered wagons and twelve oxen for pulling the wagons. Each leader gave an ox and joined with another leader to give a wagon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Accept these gifts from the leaders. These gifts can be used in the work of the Meeting Tent. Give them to the Levites to help them do their work.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Moses accepted the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He gave two wagons and four oxen to the men in Gershon’s group. They needed the wagons and the oxen for their work.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Moses gave four wagons and eight oxen to the men in Merari’s group. They needed the wagons and oxen for their work. Ithamar son of Aaron the priest was responsible for the work of all these men.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Moses did not give any oxen or wagons to the men in Kohath’s group, because their job was to carry the holy things on their shoulders. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When Moses anointed the altar, the leaders brought offerings for its dedication. They gave their offerings to the Lord at the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The LORD told Moses, “Each day one leader must bring his gift for the dedication of the altar.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12-83&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> In the Hebrew text each leader’s gift is listed separately.

Each leader also brought 1 male goat to be used as a sin offering. Each leader brought 2 cattle, 5 rams, 5 male goats, and 5 male lambs a year old. All of them were sacrificed for a fellowship offering. </div><div class='p'>On the first day, the leader of the tribe of Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the second day, the leader of the tribe of Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the third day, the leader of the tribe of Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the fourth day, the leader of the tribe of Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the fifth day, the leader of the tribe of Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the sixth day, the leader of the tribe of Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Deuel Or “Reuel.”</span></a> brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the seventh day, the leader of the tribe of Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the eighth day, the leader of the tribe of Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the ninth day, the leader of the tribe of Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the tenth day, the leader of the tribe of Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the eleventh day, the leader of the tribe of Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'>On the twelfth day, the leader of the tribe of Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan brought his gifts. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V84">84&#160;</span>So all these things were the gifts from the leaders of the Israelites. They brought them during the time that Moses dedicated the altar by anointing it. They brought 12 silver plates, 12 silver bowls, and 12 gold spoons.  <span class="verse" id="V85">85&#160;</span>Each silver plate weighed about 3 1/4 pounds. And each bowl weighed about 1 3/4 pounds.

And there were 12 male goats to be used for a sin offering.  <span class="verse" id="V88">88&#160;</span>The leaders also gave animals to be killed and used as a fellowship offering. The total number of these animals was 24 bulls, 60 rams, 60 male goats, and 60 one-year-old male lambs. In this way they dedicated the altar after Moses anointed it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V89">89&#160;</span>When Moses went into the Meeting Tent to speak to the Lord, he heard the Lord’s voice speaking to him. The voice was coming from the area between the two Cherub angels on the mercy-cover on top of the Box of the Agreement. In this way the Lord spoke to Moses. </div><ul class='tnav'>
