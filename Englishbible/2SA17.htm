<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='s'>Ahithophel’s Advice About David </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Ahithophel also said to Absalom, “Now, let me choose 12,000 men to chase David tonight.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will catch him while he is tired and weak. I will frighten him, and all his people will run away. But I will kill only King David.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then I will bring all the people back to you. If David is dead, all the people will come back in peace.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>This plan seemed good to Absalom and all the leaders of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Arkite. I also want to hear what he says.” </div><div class='s'>Hushai Ruins Ahithophel’s Advice </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Hushai came to Absalom. Absalom said to Hushai, “This is the plan Ahithophel gave. Should we follow it? If not, tell us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Hushai said to Absalom, “Ahithophel’s advice is not good this time.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Hushai added, “You know that your father and his men are strong men. They are as dangerous as a wild bear when something has taken its cubs. Your father is a skilled fighter. He will not stay all night with the people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He is probably already hiding in a cave or some other place. If your father attacks your men first, people will hear the news and think, ‘Absalom’s followers are losing!’  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then even your bravest men will be frightened, because all the Israelites know that your father is a powerful soldier and that his men are very brave. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“This is what I suggest: You must gather all the Israelites together from Dan to Beersheba.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Dan to Beersheba This means the whole nation of Israel, north and south. Dan was a town in the northern part of Israel, and Beersheba was in the southern part of Judah.</span></a> Then there will be many people, like the sand by the sea. Then you yourself must go into the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>We will catch David wherever he is hiding and attack him with so many soldiers that they will be like the dew that covers the ground. We will kill David and all of his men—no one will be left alive.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But if David escapes into a city, all the Israelites can bring ropes to that city and pull its walls down into the valley. Not even a small stone will be left in that city.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Absalom and all the Israelites said, “Hushai’s advice is better than Ahithophel’s.” Actually, Ahithophel’s advice was good, but they said this because the LORD had decided to make Ahithophel’s advice useless. He did this to punish Absalom. </div><div class='s'>Hushai Sends a Warning to David </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Hushai told the priests, Zadok and Abiathar, what was said. He told them what Ahithophel suggested to Absalom and the leaders of Israel. Hushai also told them what he himself had suggested. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“Send a message to David now! Tell him not to spend the night at the places where people cross into the desert. Tell him to go across the Jordan River at once. If he crosses the river, the king and all his people will not be caught.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The priests’ sons, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, did not want to be seen going into the town, so they waited at En Rogel. A servant girl went out to them and gave them the message. Then Jonathan and Ahimaaz carried the message to King David. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But a boy saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz and ran to tell Absalom. Jonathan and Ahimaaz ran away quickly. They arrived at a man’s house in Bahurim. The man had a well in his courtyard.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> courtyard An open area outside the house. Many houses were built around courtyards so that people could work, cook, or eat outside.</span></a> Jonathan and Ahimaaz went down into this well.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The man’s wife spread a sheet over the mouth of the well and covered it with grain. The well looked like a pile of grain, so no one would know to look there.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house. They asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” </div><div class='p'>The woman said to Absalom’s servants, “They have already crossed over the brook.” </div><div class='p'>Absalom’s servants then went to look for Jonathan and Ahimaaz, but they could not find them. So Absalom’s servants went back to Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>After Absalom’s servants left, Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well and went to King David. They said to David, “Hurry, go across the river. Ahithophel is planning to do something to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So David and his people crossed over the Jordan River. By sunrise, all of David’s people had crossed the Jordan River. No one was left behind. </div><div class='s'>Ahithophel Kills Himself </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When Ahithophel saw that the Israelites did not do what he suggested, he saddled his donkey and went back to his hometown. He made plans for his family and then hanged himself. They buried him in his father’s tomb. </div><div class='s'>Absalom Crosses the Jordan River </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>David arrived at Mahanaim just as Absalom and the Israelites who were with him crossed over the Jordan River.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25-26&#160;</span>Absalom and the Israelites made their camp in the land of Gilead. Absalom had made Amasa the new captain of the army. He took Joab’s place.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> He took Joab’s place Joab still supported David. Joab was one of the three captains in David’s army when David was running away from Absalom. See 2 Sam. 18:2.</span></a> Amasa was the son of Ithra the Ishmaelite.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Ishmaelite This is from the ancient Greek version. The standard Hebrew text has “Israelite,” but see 1 Chron. 2:17.</span></a> His mother was Abigail, the daughter of Nahash, the sister of Joab’s mother, Zeruiah.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> His mother … Zeruiah Literally, “Ithra had sexual relations with Abigail, the daughter of Nahash sister of Zeruiah.”</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Shobi, Makir, and Barzillai </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>When David arrived at Mahanaim, Shobi, Makir, and Barzillai were there. Shobi son of Nahash was from the Ammonite town of Rabbah. Makir son of Ammiel was from Lo Debar. Barzillai was from Rogelim in Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28-29&#160;</span>These three men said, “The people are tired, hungry, and thirsty from the desert.” So they brought many things to David and those with him. They brought beds, bowls, and other kinds of dishes. They also brought wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, dried seeds, honey, butter, sheep, and cheese made from cow’s milk. </div><ul class='tnav'>
