<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='s'>David Becomes King Over Israel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>All the Israelites came to David at the town of Hebron. They said to David, “We are your own flesh and blood.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> We are … blood A way of saying they were David’s relatives.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In the past you led us in war. You led us even though Saul was the king. The LORD said to you ‘David, you will be the shepherd of my people, the Israelites. You will become the leader over my people.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>All the leaders of Israel came to King David at the town of Hebron. David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the LORD. The leaders anointed David. That made him king over Israel. The LORD had promised through Samuel that this would happen. </div><div class='s'>David Captures Jerusalem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>David and all the Israelites went to the city of Jerusalem. Jerusalem was called Jebus at that time. The people living in that city were named Jebusites. They  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>said to David, “You cannot get inside our city.” But David did defeat them. He took over the fortress of Zion, and it became the City of David. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>David said, “The one who leads the attack on the Jebusites will become the commander over all my army.” So Joab led the attack. He was Zeruiah’s son. Joab became the commander of the army. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then David made his home in the fortress. That is why it is named the City of David.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>David built the city around the fort. He built it from the Millo to the wall around the city. Joab repaired the other parts of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>David continued to grow greater, and the LORD All-Powerful was with him. </div><div class='s'>The Three Heroes </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>This is a list of the leaders over David’s special soldiers. These heroes became very powerful with David in his kingdom. They and all the Israelites supported David and made him king, just as the LORD had promised. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This is a list of David’s special soldiers: </div><div class='p'>Jashobeam the Hacmonite<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Jashobeam the Hacmonite This is “Josheb Basshebeth the Tahkemonite” in 2 Sam. 23:8.</span></a> was the leader of the king’s special forces.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> king’s special forces A special group of soldiers who formed three-man squads and went on special missions for the king.</span></a> Jashobeam used his spear to kill 300 men at one time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Next there was Eleazar son of Dodai<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Eleazar son of Dodai Or “Eleazar his cousin.”</span></a> from Ahoah. Eleazar was one of the Three Heroes.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Three Heroes These were David’s three bravest soldiers. Also in verses 18, 20, 24.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Eleazar was with David at Pasdammim. The Philistines had come to that place to fight a war. There was a field full of barley there. The Israelites ran away from the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the Three Heroes stood there in that field and defended it. They defeated the Philistines. The LORD gave the Israelites a great victory. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Once David was at the cave of Adullam, and three of the Thirty Heroes<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Thirty Heroes Or “the king’s special forces.” These men were David’s famous group of very brave soldiers. Also in verses 25, 42.</span></a> went down to meet him by a rock near the cave. At the same time the Philistine army was camped in the Valley of Rephaim. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Another time David was in the fortress, and a group of Philistine soldiers was stationed in Bethlehem.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>David was thirsty for some water from his hometown, so he said, “Oh, if only I could have some water from that well by the gate in Bethlehem.”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So the Three Heroes<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Three Heroes These were David’s three bravest soldiers. Also in verses 19-21.</span></a> fought their way through the Philistine army and got some water from the well near the city gate in Bethlehem. They took it to David, but he refused to drink it. He poured it on the ground as an offering to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>David said, “God, I cannot drink this water. It would be like drinking the blood of the men who risked their lives to get this water for me.” That is why David refused to drink the water. The Three Heroes did many brave things like that. </div><div class='s'>Other Brave Soldiers </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Joab’s brother, Abishai, was the leader of the Three Heroes. Abishai used his spear against 300 enemies and killed them. He was as famous as the Three Heroes.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Abishai was even more famous than the Three Heroes.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Three Heroes Or possibly, “The Thirty Heroes.”</span></a> He became their leader, even though he was not one of the Three Heroes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then there was Benaiah son of Jehoiada, from Kabzeel. He was the son of a powerful man.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> powerful man That is, a man from the warrior class ready to protect his people in war.</span></a> Benaiah did many brave things. He killed two of the best soldiers in Moab. One day when it was snowing, Benaiah went down into a hole in the ground and killed a lion.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Benaiah killed a big Egyptian soldier. That man was about 7 1/2 feet<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> about 7 1/2 feet Literally, “5 <span class='add'>short </span>cubits” (2.22 m).</span></a> tall. The Egyptian had a spear that was very large and heavy. It was as big as the pole on a weaver’s loom. Benaiah had only a club. He grabbed the spear in the Egyptian’s hands and took it away from him. Then Benaiah killed the Egyptian with his own spear.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Benaiah son of Jehoiada did many brave things like that. He was as famous as the Three Heroes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Benaiah was even more famous than the Thirty Heroes, but he was not one of the Three Heroes. David made Benaiah the leader of his bodyguards. </div><div class='s'>The Thirty Heroes </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The following men were among the king’s special forces: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'>Asahel, Joab’s brother; </div><div class='li'>Elhanan son of Dodai from Bethlehem; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Shammoth the Harodite; </div><div class='li'>Helez the Pelonite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa; </div><div class='li'>Abiezer from Anathoth; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Sibbecai the Hushathite; </div><div class='li'>Ilai from Ahoah; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Maharai from Netophah; </div><div class='li'>Heled son of Baanah from Netophah; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin; </div><div class='li'>Benaiah the Pirathonite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Hurai from the Brooks of Gaash; </div><div class='li'>Abiel the Arbathite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Azmaveth the Baharumite; </div><div class='li'>Eliahba the Shaalbonite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>the sons of Hashem the Gizonite; </div><div class='li'>Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Ahiam son of Sacar the Hararite; </div><div class='li'>Eliphal son of Ur; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Hepher the Mekerathite; </div><div class='li'>Ahijah the Pelonite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Hezro the Carmelite; </div><div class='li'>Naarai son of Ezbai; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Joel, Nathan’s brother; </div><div class='li'>Mibhar son of Hagri; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Zelek the Ammonite; </div><div class='li'>Naharai the officer from Beeroth, who carried the armor for Joab son of Zeruiah; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Ira the Ithrite; </div><div class='li'>Gareb the Ithrite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Uriah the Hittite; </div><div class='li'>Zabad son of Ahlai; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Adina who was the son of Shiza from the tribe of Reuben and was the leader of the tribe and one of the Thirty Heroes; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Hanan son of Maacah; </div><div class='li'>Joshaphat the Mithnite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Uzzia the Ashterathite; </div><div class='li'>Shama and Jeiel sons of Hotham from Aroer; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Jediael son of Shimri </div><div class='li'>and his brother Joha the Tizite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Eliel the Mahavite; </div><div class='li'>Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam; </div><div class='li'>Ithmah the Moabite; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Eliel; Obed; and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. </div><ul class='tnav'>
