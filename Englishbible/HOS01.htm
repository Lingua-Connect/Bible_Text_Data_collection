The LORD said, “Go, marry a prostitute who has had children as a result of her prostitution. Do this because the people in this country have acted like prostitutes—they have been unfaithful to the LORD.” </div><div class='s'>The Birth of Jezreel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Hosea married Gomer daughter of Diblaim. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Hosea.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The LORD said to Hosea, “Name him Jezreel,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Jezreel This name in Hebrew means “God will plant seeds.”</span></a> because soon I will punish the family of Jehu for the people he killed at Jezreel Valley.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> people … at Jezreel Valley See 2 Kings 9-10 for the story of Jehu’s revolt at Jezreel Valley.</span></a> Then I will put an end to the kingdom of the nation<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> nation Literally, “house.” This might mean the royal family of that country.

The LORD said to Hosea, “Name her Lo-Ruhamah,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Lo-Ruhamah This name in Hebrew means “She receives no mercy.” Also in verse 8.</span></a> because I will not show mercy to the nation of Israel anymore, nor will I forgive them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But I will show mercy to the nation of Judah. I will save them, but I will not use bows or swords or war horses and soldiers to save them.
