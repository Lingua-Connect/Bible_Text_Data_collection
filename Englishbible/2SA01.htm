This was just after Saul had been killed. David had been there two days.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then, on the third day, a young soldier from Saul’s camp came to Ziklag. His clothes were torn, and he had dirt on his head.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> clothes … head This showed that the man was very sad.</span></a> He came to David and bowed with his face to the ground. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>David asked him, “Where have you come from?” </div><div class='p'>The man answered, “I just came from the Israelite camp.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>David asked him, “Please tell me, who won the battle?” </div><div class='p'>The man answered, “Our people ran away from the battle. Many of them were killed in the battle. Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>David said to the young soldier, “How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The young soldier said, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa. I saw Saul leaning on his spear. The Philistine chariots and horse soldiers were coming closer and closer to Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Saul looked back and saw me. He called to me and I answered him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Saul asked me who I was. I told him that I was an Amalekite.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Saul said, ‘Please kill me. I am hurt badly. And I am about to die anyway.’  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He was hurt so badly that I knew he wouldn’t live. So I stopped and killed him. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm and brought them here to you, my lord.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then David tore his clothes to show he was very sad. All the men with him did the same thing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They were very sad and cried. They did not eat until evening. They cried because Saul and his son Jonathan were dead. David and his men cried for the LORD’S people, and they cried for Israel. They cried because Saul, his son Jonathan, and many Israelites had been killed in battle. </div><div class='s'>David Orders the Amalekite Killed </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then David talked with the young soldier who had told him about Saul’s death. David asked, “Where are you from?” </div><div class='p'>The young soldier answered, “I am the son of a foreigner. I am an Amalekite.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>David said to the young soldier, “Why were you not afraid to kill the LORD’S chosen king<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> chosen king Literally, “anointed one.”</span></a>?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15-16&#160;</span>Then David told the Amalekite, “You are responsible for your own death. You said you killed the LORD’S chosen king, so your own words prove you are guilty.” Then David called one of his young servants and told him to kill the Amalekite. So the young Israelite killed him. </div><div class='s'>David’s Song About Saul and Jonathan </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>David sang a sad song about Saul and his son Jonathan.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>David told his men to teach the song to the people of Judah.
