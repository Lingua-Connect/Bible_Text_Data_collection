<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='s'>The People Confess Their Sin </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Ezra was praying and confessing. He was crying and bowing down in front of God’s Temple. While Ezra was doing that, a large group of the Israelites—men, women, and children—gathered around him. They were crying.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, spoke to Ezra and said, “We have not been faithful to our God. We have married the people living around us. But, even though we have done this, there is still hope for Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now let us make an agreement before our God to send away all these women and their children. We will do that to follow the advice of Ezra and the people who respect the laws of our God. We will obey God’s law.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Get up, Ezra. This is your responsibility, but we will support you. So be brave and do it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So Ezra got up. He made the leading priests, the Levites, and all the Israelites promise to do what he said.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Ezra went away from the front of God’s house. He went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While Ezra was there, he didn’t eat food or drink water. He did that because he was still very sad. He was very sad about the Israelites who came back to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then he sent a message to every place in Judah and Jerusalem. The message told all the Jewish people who had come back from captivity to meet together in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Those who did not come to Jerusalem in three days like the officials and elders said would lose their property and be removed from the group. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So in three days all the men from the families of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> ninth month That is, November–December.</span></a> all the people met together in the Temple yard. They were very upset because of the reason for the meeting and because of the heavy rain.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Ezra the priest stood and said to them, “You people have not been faithful to God. You have married foreign women. You have made Israel more guilty by doing that.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now you must confess your sins to the LORD, the God of your ancestors. You must obey his command. Separate yourselves from the people living around you and from your foreign wives.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the whole group who met together answered Ezra. They shouted, “Ezra, you are right! We must do what you say.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But there are many people here. And it is the rainy time of year, so we cannot stay outside. This problem cannot be solved in a day or two because we have sinned in a very bad way.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let our leaders decide for the whole group meeting here. Then let every man in our towns who married a foreign woman come here to Jerusalem at a planned time. Let them come here with the elders and judges of their towns. Then God will stop being angry with us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Only a few men were against this plan. They were Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah. Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite also were against the plan. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the Israelites who came back to Jerusalem accepted the plan. Ezra the priest chose men who were family leaders. He chose one man from each tribe. Each man was chosen by name. On the first day of the tenth month,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> tenth month That is, December–January.</span></a> the men who were chosen sat down to study each of the cases.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And by the first day of the first month,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> first month That is, March–April.</span></a> they finished discussing all the men who had married foreign women. </div><div class='s'>List of Men Who <br/> Married Foreign Women </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>These are the names of the descendants of the priests who married foreign women: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'>From the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and Jeshua’s brothers, these men: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All of them promised to divorce their wives.
