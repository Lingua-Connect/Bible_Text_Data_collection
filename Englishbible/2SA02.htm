All of them made their homes in Hebron and the towns nearby. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The men of Judah came to Hebron and anointed David to be the king of Judah. Then they told David, “The men of Jabesh Gilead buried Saul.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead. These messengers told the men in Jabesh: “The LORD bless you, because you have shown kindness to your lord Saul by burying him.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> burying him The bodies of both Saul and Jonathan were burned and their bones were buried.

He ruled Israel two years, but the tribe of Judah followed David.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>David ruled over the tribe of Judah from Hebron for seven years and six months. </div><div class='s'>The Deadly Contest </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Abner son of Ner and the officers of Ish Bosheth son of Saul left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Joab, Zeruiah’s son, and the officers of David also went to Gibeon. They met Abner and Ish Bosheth’s officers at the pool of Gibeon. Abner’s group sat on one side of the pool. Joab’s group sat on the other side. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have the young soldiers get up and have a contest here.” </div><div class='p'>Joab said, “Yes, let’s have a contest.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the young soldiers got up. The two groups counted their men for the contest. They chose twelve men from the tribe of Benjamin to fight for Ish Bosheth son of Saul, and they chose twelve men from David’s officers.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Each of the men grabbed his opponent’s head and stabbed him in the side with his sword, and then they fell down together. That is why this place in Gibeon is called “The Field of the Sharp Knives.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The Field of the Sharp Knives Or “Helkath Hazzurim.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>That contest turned into a terrible battle and David’s officers defeated Abner and the Israelites that day. </div><div class='s'>Abner Kills Asahel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Zeruiah had three sons, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was a fast runner, as fast as a wild deer.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Asahel ran straight toward Abner and began chasing him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Abner looked back and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?” </div><div class='p'>Asahel said, “Yes, it’s me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Abner didn’t want to hurt Asahel, so he said to Asahel, “Stop chasing me—go after one of the young soldiers. You could easily take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel refused to stop chasing Abner. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Abner again said to Asahel, “Stop chasing me, or I will have to kill you. Then I will not be able to look your brother Joab in the face again.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But Asahel refused to stop chasing Abner. So Abner used the back end of his spear and pushed it into Asahel’s stomach. The spear went deep into Asahel’s stomach and came out of his back. Asahel died right there. </div><div class='s'>Joab and Abishai Chase Abner </div><div class='p'>Asahel’s body lay on the ground. Everyone who came that way stopped to look at Asahel,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>but Joab and Abishai<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Joab and Abishai Brothers of Asahel, the man who Abner killed.

(Ammah Hill is in front of Giah on the way to the desert of Gibeon.)  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The men from the tribe of Benjamin gathered around Abner at the top of the hill. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Abner shouted to Joab and said, “Must we fight and kill each other forever? Surely you know that this will only end in sadness. Tell the people to stop chasing their own brothers.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then Joab said, “As surely as God is alive, if you had not said something, people would still be chasing their brothers in the morning.”  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Joab blew a trumpet, and his people stopped chasing the Israelites. They did not try to fight the Israelites anymore. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Abner and his men marched all night through the Jordan Valley. They crossed the Jordan River and then marched all day until they came to Mahanaim. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Joab stopped chasing Abner and turned back. Joab had gathered his men and learned that 19 of David’s officers were missing, including Asahel.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But David’s officers had killed 360 of Abner’s men from the tribe of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>David’s officers took Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father at Bethlehem. </div><div class='p'>Joab and his men marched all night.
