He was the highest officer in the Temple of the LORD. When he heard Jeremiah say those things in the Temple yard,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten. And he had Jeremiah’s hands and feet locked between large blocks of wood. This was at the Upper Gate of Benjamin of the LORD’S Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The next day Pashhur took Jeremiah out from between the blocks of wood. Then Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD’S name for you is not Pashhur. Now his name for you is, ‘Surrounded by Terror.’  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>That is your name because of what the LORD says: ‘I will soon make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. You will watch enemies killing your friends with swords. I will give all the people of Judah to the king of Babylon. He will take them away to the country of Babylon, and his army will kill the people of Judah with their swords.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The people of Jerusalem worked hard to build things and become wealthy, but I will give all these things to their enemies. The king in Jerusalem has many treasures, but I will give all the treasures to the enemy. The enemy will take them and carry them away to the country of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And, Pashhur, you and all the people living in your house will be taken away. You will be forced to go and live in the country of Babylon. You will die in Babylon, and you will be buried in that foreign country. You told lies to your friends. You said these things would not happen. But all your friends will also die and be buried in Babylon.’ ” </div><div class='s'>Jeremiah’s Fifth Complaint </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>LORD, you tricked me, and I certainly was fooled. </div><div class='q2'>You are stronger than I am, so you won. </div><div class='q'>I have become a joke. </div><div class='q2'>People laugh at me and make fun of me all day long. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Every time I speak, I shout. </div><div class='q2'>I am always shouting about violence and destruction. </div><div class='q'>I tell the people about the message that I received from the LORD. </div><div class='q2'>But they only insult me and make fun of me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Sometimes I say to myself, “I will forget about him. </div><div class='q2'>I will not speak anymore in his name.” </div><div class='q'>But when I say that, his message is like a fire burning inside me! </div><div class='q2'>It feels like it is burning deep in my bones! </div><div class='q'>I get tired of trying to hold his message inside. </div><div class='q2'>And finally, I am not able to hold it in. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I hear people whispering against me. </div><div class='q2'>Everywhere, I hear things that frighten me. </div><div class='q2'>Even my friends are speaking against me. </div><div class='q'>People are just waiting for me to make a mistake. </div><div class='q2'>They are saying, “Let us lie and say that he did something bad. </div><div class='q'>Maybe we can trick Jeremiah. </div><div class='q2'>Then we will have him. </div><div class='q2'>We will finally be rid of him. </div><div class='q'>Then we will grab him </div><div class='q2'>and take our revenge on him.” </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the LORD is with me. </div><div class='q2'>He is like a strong soldier. </div><div class='q'>So those who are chasing me will fall. </div><div class='q2'>They will not defeat me. </div><div class='q'>They will fail. </div><div class='q2'>They will be disappointed. </div><div class='q'>They will be ashamed, </div><div class='q2'>and they will never forget that shame. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>LORD All-Powerful, you test good people. </div><div class='q2'>You look deeply into a person’s mind. </div><div class='q'>I told you my arguments against these people. </div><div class='q2'>So let me see you give them the punishment they deserve. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Sing to the LORD! </div><div class='q2'>Praise the LORD! </div><div class='q'>He saves the lives of the poor! </div><div class='q2'>He saves them from the wicked! </div><div class='s'>Jeremiah’s Sixth Complaint </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Curse the day that I was born! </div><div class='q2'>Don’t bless the day my mother had me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Curse the man who told my father the news that I was born. </div><div class='q2'>“It’s a boy!” he said. </div><div class='q2'>“You have a son.” </div><div class='q'>He made my father very happy </div><div class='q2'>when he told him the news. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let that man be like the cities the LORD destroyed.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> cities the LORD destroyed That is, Sodom and Gomorrah.
