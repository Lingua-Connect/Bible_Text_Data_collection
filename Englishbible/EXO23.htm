Don’t make false charges against a person. Never allow innocent people to be killed as punishment for something they did not do.

You must come to my special place to worship me during these festivals.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The first festival is the Festival of Unleavened Bread. This is as I commanded you. During this time you will eat bread that is made without yeast. This will continue for seven days. You will do this during the month of Abib, because this is the time when you came out of Egypt. Everyone must bring a sacrifice to me at that time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“The second festival will be the Festival of Harvest.
