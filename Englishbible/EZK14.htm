<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='s'>Warnings Against Idol Worship </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Some of the elders of Israel came to me. They sat down to talk with me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The word of the LORD came to me. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“Son of man,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “a person” or “a human being.” Here, it is a way of addressing Ezekiel. Also in verse 13.</span></a> these men came to talk to you. But they still have their filthy idols. They kept the things that made them sin. They still worship those statues, so why do they come to me for advice? Should I answer their questions?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But I will give them an answer. You must tell them this: ‘This is what the Lord GOD says: If any Israelites come to a prophet and ask me for advice, I myself will answer their questions. I, the LORD, will answer them even if they still have their filthy idols, even if they kept the things that made them sin, and even if they still worship those statues. I will speak to them in spite of all their filthy idols.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>This is because I want to touch their hearts. I want to show them that I love them, even though they left me for their filthy idols.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“So tell the family of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says: Come back to me and leave your filthy idols. Turn away from those terrible, false gods.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If any Israelites or foreigners who live in Israel come to me for advice, I will give them an answer. I, the LORD, will answer them even if they still have their filthy idols, even if they kept the things that made them sin, and even if they worship those statues. This is the answer I will give them:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I will turn against them and destroy them. They will be an example to others. People will laugh at them. I will remove them from my people. Then you will know that I am the LORD!  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And if a prophet is foolish enough to give his own answer, I, the LORD, will show him how foolish he is! I will use my power against him. I will destroy him and remove him from among my people, Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So both the one who came for advice and the prophet who gave an answer will get the same punishment.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Why? So that those prophets will stop leading my people away from me, and my people will stop being filthy with sin. Then they will be my special people, and I will be their God.’ ” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='s'>Jerusalem Will Be Punished </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the word of the LORD came to me. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Son of man, I will punish any nation that leaves me and sins against me. I will stop their food supply. I might cause a famine and remove the people and animals from that country.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I would punish that country even if Noah, Daniel, and Job<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Noah, Daniel, and Job Three men from ancient times.

Then you will know that I had a good reason for punishing them.” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><ul class='tnav'>
