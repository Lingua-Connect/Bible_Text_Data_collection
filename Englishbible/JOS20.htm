Then the leaders can allow you to enter the city. They will give you a place to live among them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If someone chases you and follows you to that city, the leaders of the city must not give you up. They must protect you because you came to them for safety after killing someone by accident—you were not angry and did not plan to kill the person. It was something that just happened.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You should stay in that city until the court has judged you and until the high priest dies. Then you may go back to your hometown.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So the Israelites chose some cities to be called cities of safety. These are the cities: Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali; Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim; Kiriath Arba (Hebron) in the hill country of Judah;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Bezer, east of the Jordan River across from Jericho, in the desert area in the land of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead in the land of Gad; and Golan in Bashan in the land of Manasseh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>All Israelites or any foreigners living among them who killed someone by accident were allowed to run away to one of these cities of safety. They could be safe there and not be killed by anyone chasing them. The court in that city would judge them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
