The side rooms rested on these ledges but were not connected to the Temple wall itself.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Each floor of the side rooms around the Temple was wider than the floor below. The walls of the rooms around the Temple became narrower the higher they went so that the rooms on the top floors were wider.

A palm tree was between each Cherub angel. Every Cherub angel had two faces.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>One face was a man’s face looking toward the palm tree on one side. The other face was a lion’s face looking toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved all around on the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>From the floor to the area above the door, Cherub angels and palm trees were carved on all walls of the Holy Place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The walls on either side of the Holy Place were square.

Each door was really two swinging doors.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Also Cherub angels and palm trees were carved on the doors of the Holy Place. They were like those carved on the walls. There was a wood roof over the front of the porch.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There were windows with frames around them and palm trees on the walls on both sides of the porch, on the roof over the porch, and on the rooms around the Temple. </div><ul class='tnav'>
