<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='s'>War With the Canaanites </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The Canaanite king of Arad lived in the Negev. He heard that the Israelites were coming on the road to Atharim, so the king went out and attacked the Israelites. Arad captured some of the people and made them prisoners.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then the Israelites made a special promise to the LORD: “Please help us defeat these people. If you do this, we will give their cities to you. We will totally destroy them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The LORD listened to the Israelites and helped them defeat the Canaanites. They completely destroyed the Canaanites and their cities. So that place was named Hormah.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Hormah This name means “completely destroyed” or “a gift given totally to God.” See Leviticus 27:28-29.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>The Bronze Snake </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The Israelites left Mount Hor and traveled on the road that goes to the Red Sea. They did this to go around the country of Edom. But the people became impatient.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They began complaining against God and Moses. The people said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? We will die here in the desert! There is no bread and no water! And we hate this terrible food!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So the LORD sent poisonous snakes among the people. The snakes bit the people, and many of the Israelites died.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The people came to Moses and said, “We know that we sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD. Ask him to take away these snakes.” So Moses prayed for them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses, “Make a bronze snake and put it on a pole. If anyone is bitten by a snake, that person should look at the bronze snake on the pole. Then that person will not die.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole. Then when a snake bit anyone, that person looked at the bronze snake on the pole and lived. </div><div class='s'>The Trip to Moab </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Israelites left that place and camped at Oboth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then they left Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim in the desert east of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They left that place and camped in Zered Valley.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then they moved and camped across from the Arnon River in the desert. This river started at the Ammonite border. The valley was the border between Moab and the Amorites.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That is why these words are written in the <span class='bk'>Book of the Wars of the LORD</span>: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='mi'>“… and Waheb in Suphah, and the Valleys of the Arnon,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and the hills by the valleys that lead to the town of Ar. These places are at the border of Moab.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The Israelites left that place and traveled to Beer.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Beer This Hebrew name means “well.”</span></a> There is a well in Beer, where the LORD said to Moses, “Bring the people together here, and I will give them water.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then the Israelites sang this song: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Well, flow with water! </div><div class='q2'>Sing about it! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Great men dug this well. </div><div class='q2'>Important leaders dug this well. </div><div class='q'>They dug this well with their staffs and walking sticks. </div><div class='q2'>It is a gift in the desert.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> gift in the desert In Hebrew this is the name “Mattanah.”</span></a> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The people traveled from Mattanah to Nahaliel. Then they traveled from Nahaliel to Bamoth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They traveled from Bamoth to the Valley of Moab. In this place the top of the Pisgah Mountain looks over the desert. </div><div class='s'>Sihon and Og </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Israelites sent some men to King Sihon of the Amorites. The men said to the king, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“Allow us to travel through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard. We will not drink water from any of your wells. We will travel only along King’s Road. We will stay on that road until we have traveled through your country.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But King Sihon would not allow the Israelites to travel through his country. He gathered together his army and marched out to the desert to fight against the Israelites. The king’s army fought against the Israelites at Jahaz. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But the Israelites defeated the king and took his land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River. The Israelites took the land as far as the Ammonite border. They stopped at that border because it was strongly defended by the Ammonites.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Israel took all the Amorite cities and began living in them. They even defeated the city of Heshbon and all the small towns around it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Heshbon was the city where Sihon, the Amorite king, lived. In the past Sihon had fought with the king of Moab. Sihon had taken the land as far as the Arnon River.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>That is why the singers sing this song: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Go in and rebuild Heshbon! </div><div class='q2'>Make Sihon’s city strong. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>A fire began in Heshbon. </div><div class='q2'>That fire began in Sihon’s city. </div><div class='q'>The fire destroyed Ar in Moab. </div><div class='q2'>It burned the hills above Arnon River. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>It is bad for you, Moab. </div><div class='q2'>You lost Chemosh’s people. </div><div class='q'>His sons ran away. </div><div class='q2'>His daughters were taken prisoners by Sihon, king of the Amorites. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But we defeated those Amorites. </div><div class='q2'>We destroyed their towns from Heshbon to Dibon, </div><div class='q2'>from Nashim to Nophah, near Medeba.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So the Israelites made their camp in the land of the Amorites. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Moses sent some men to look at the town of Jazer. Then the Israelites captured that town and the small towns that were around it. They forced the Amorites who were living there to leave. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then the Israelites traveled on the road toward Bashan. King Og of Bashan got his army and marched out to meet the Israelites. He fought against them at Edrei. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the LORD said to Moses, “Don’t be afraid of that king. I will allow you to defeat him. You will take his whole army and all his land. Do the same to him as you did to Sihon, the Amorite king who lived in Heshbon.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So the Israelites defeated Og and his army.
