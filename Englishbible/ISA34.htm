Listen, all you people. The earth and everyone on it should listen to these things. Everything in this world should hear this.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The LORD is angry with all the nations and their armies. He will destroy them all and put them to death.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Their bodies will be thrown outside. The stink will rise from the bodies, and the blood will flow down the mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The skies will be rolled shut like a scroll,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> rolled shut like a scroll This is like someone closing a book when they have finished reading it.</span></a> and the stars will die and fall like leaves from a vine or a fig tree. All the stars<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> stars Literally, “the armies of the skies.”</span></a> in the sky will rot away.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The Lord says, “This will happen when my sword in the sky is covered with blood.” </div><div class='p'>Look, the LORD’S sword will cut through Edom. He judged them guilty, and they must die.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> guilty, and they must die The Hebrew means the people belonged completely to God, and if he does not get them, they must die.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The LORD decided there should be a time for killing in Bozrah and in Edom. So the sword of the LORD is covered with blood and fat. The blood is from the “goats.” The fat is from the kidneys of the “rams.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> goats … rams This probably refers to the people and leaders of Edom.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So the rams, the cattle, and the strong bulls will be killed. The land will be filled with their blood. The dirt will be covered with their fat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This will happen because the LORD has chosen a time for punishment. He has chosen a year when people must pay for the wrong they did to Zion.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Edom’s rivers will be like hot tar. Edom’s ground will be like burning sulfur.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The fires will burn day and night—no one will stop the fire. The smoke will rise from Edom forever. The land will be destroyed forever and ever. No one will ever travel through that land again.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Birds and small animals will own that land. It will be a home for owls and ravens. God will leave that land in ruins. People will call it “the empty desert.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> God … desert Literally, “He will stretch over it the measuring string of ‘emptiness’ and the stone weights of ‘nothingness.’ ” These two words described the empty earth in Genesis 1:2.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The freemen<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> freemen Important citizens of a town or country.

Wild dogs and owls will live in them. Wild animals will make their homes there.

Not one will be without its mate.

He drew a line and showed them their land. So the animals will own that land forever. They will live there year after year. </div><ul class='tnav'>
