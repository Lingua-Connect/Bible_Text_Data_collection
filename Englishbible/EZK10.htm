<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='s'>The Glory of the Lord <br/> Leaves the Temple </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then I looked up at the bowl<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> bowl This Hebrew word is the same word used in Genesis 1:6-7 to describe the dome of the sky.</span></a> over the heads of the Cherub angels. The bowl looked clear blue like sapphire, and there was something that looked like a throne over it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then the one sitting on the throne said to the man dressed in linen clothes,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> linen clothes Priests usually wore these clothes.</span></a> “Step into the area between the wheels<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> area between the wheels The Hebrew word can mean “chariot wheel,” “whirling (spinning) wheel,” or “tumbling weed.” See chapter 1 for Ezekiel’s full description. Also in verse 6.</span></a> under the Cherub angels. Take a handful of the burning coals from between the Cherub angels and go throw them over the city of Jerusalem.” </div><div class='p'>The man walked past me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The Cherub angels were standing in the area south<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> south Literally, “right.”</span></a> of the Temple as the man walked to them. The cloud filled the inner courtyard.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the Glory of the LORD rose up off the Cherub angels near the threshold of the door of the Temple. Then the cloud filled the Temple, and the bright light from the Glory of the LORD filled the whole courtyard.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The noise from the wings of the Cherub angels could be heard all the way out into the outer courtyard. The sound was very loud—like the thundering voice when God All-Powerful speaks. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>God had given the man dressed in linen clothes a command. He had told him to go into the area between the wheels among the Cherub angels and get some hot coals. So the man went there and stood by the wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>One of the Cherub angels reached out his hand and took some of the hot coals from the area between the Cherub angels. He poured the coals into the man’s hands, and the man left.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>(The Cherub angels had what looked like human arms under their wings.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then I noticed that there were four wheels. There was one wheel by each Cherub angel, and the wheels looked like a clear yellow jewel.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>There were four wheels, and they all looked the same. They looked like there was a wheel in a wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They could go in any direction when they moved, but <span class='add'>the Cherub angels</span> did not turn around when they moved. They went in the direction that the head was looking. They did not turn around when they moved.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There were eyes all over their bodies. There were eyes on their backs, on their arms, on their wings, and on their wheels—on all four wheels!  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>These wheels were what I heard called, “the area between the wheels.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14-15&#160;</span>Each Cherub angel had four faces. The first was the face of a Cherub,<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> face of a Cherub This is the bull’s face mentioned in Ezekiel 1:10. See Ezekiel 10:22.</span></a> the second was the face of a man, the third was a lion’s face, and the fourth was an eagle’s face. (These Cherub angels were the living beings I saw in the vision by the Kebar Canal.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> vision by the Kebar Canal See Ezekiel 1.</span></a>) </div><div class='p'>Then the Cherub angels rose into the air,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and the wheels rose with them. When the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air, not even the wheels turned around.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If they flew into the air, the wheels went with them. If they stood still, so did the wheels, because the spirit<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> spirit Or “wind.”</span></a> of the living being was in them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then the Glory of the LORD rose from the threshold of the Temple, moved to the place over the Cherub angels, and stopped there.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air. I saw them leave. The wheels went with them. Then they stopped at the East Gate of the LORD’S Temple. The Glory of the God of Israel was in the air above them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>These were the living beings under the Glory of the God of Israel in the vision at the Kebar Canal, and now I realized that they were Cherub angels.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Each living being had four faces, four wings, and something that looked like human arms under their wings.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The faces of the Cherub angels were the same as the four faces on the living beings in the vision by the Kebar Canal. They all looked straight ahead in the direction they were going. </div><ul class='tnav'>
