<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='s'>Wise Sayings About Fools </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Just as snow should not fall in summer, nor rain at harvest time, so people should not honor a fool. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Don’t worry when someone curses you for no reason. Nothing bad will happen. Such words are like birds that fly past and never stop. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You have to whip a horse, you have to put a bridle on a mule, and you have to beat a fool. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4-5&#160;</span>There is no good way to answer fools when they say something stupid. If you answer them, then you, too, will look like a fool. If you don’t answer them, they will think they are smart. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Never let a fool carry your message. If you do, it will be like cutting off your own feet. You are only asking for trouble. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>A fool trying to say something wise is like a crippled person trying to walk. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Showing honor to a fool is as bad as tying a rock in a sling. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A fool trying to say something wise is like a drunk trying to pick a thorn out of his hand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hiring a fool or a stranger who is just passing by is dangerous—you don’t know who might get hurt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Like a dog that returns to its vomit, a fool does the same foolish things again and again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>People who think they are wise when they are not are worse than fools. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A person who is lazy and wants to stay home says, “What if there is a lion out there? Really, there might be a lion in the street!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Like a door on its hinges, a lazy man turns back and forth on his bed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Lazy people are too lazy to lift the food from their plate to their mouth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Lazy people think they are seven times smarter than the people who really have good sense. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>To step between two people arguing is as foolish as going out into the street and grabbing a stray dog by the ears. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18-19&#160;</span>Anyone who would trick someone and then say, “I was only joking” is like a fool who shoots flaming arrows into the air and accidentally kills someone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Without wood, a fire goes out. Without gossip, arguments stop. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Charcoal keeps the coals glowing, wood keeps the fire burning, and troublemakers keep arguments alive. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>People love to hear gossip. It is like tasty food on its way to the stomach. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Good words that hide an evil heart are like silver paint over a cheap, clay pot.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Evil people say things to make themselves look good, but they keep their evil plans a secret.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>What they say sounds good, but don’t trust them. They are full of evil ideas.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They hide their evil plans with nice words, but in the end, everyone will see the evil they do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Whoever digs a pit can fall into it. Whoever rolls a large stone can be crushed by it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Liars hate the people they hurt, and false praise can hurt people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
