<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='s'>Circumcision—Proof of the Agreement </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When Abram was 99 years old, the LORD appeared to him. He said, “I am God All-Powerful.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> God All-Powerful Literally, “El Shaddai.”</span></a> Obey me and live the right way.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>If you do this, I will prepare an agreement between us. I will promise to make your people a great nation.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Abram bowed down before God. God said to him,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“This is my part of our agreement: I will make you the father of many nations.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I will change your name from Abram<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Abram This name means “honored father.”</span></a> to Abraham,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Abraham This name means “great father” or “father of many.”</span></a> because I am making you the father of many nations.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will give you many descendants. New nations and kings will come from you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I will prepare an agreement between me and you. This agreement will also be for all your descendants. It will continue forever. I will be your God and the God of all your descendants.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I will give this land to you and to all your descendants. I will give you the land you are traveling through—the land of Canaan. I will give you this land forever, and I will be your God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then God said to Abraham, “Now, this is your part of the agreement: You and all your descendants will obey my agreement.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>This is my agreement that all of you must obey. This is the agreement between me and you and all your descendants. Every male must be circumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>You will cut the skin to show that you follow the agreement between me and you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When the baby boy is eight days old, you will circumcise him. Every boy born among your people and every boy who is a slave of your people must be circumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So every baby boy in your nation will be circumcised. Every boy who is born from your family or bought as a slave will be circumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Abraham, this is the agreement between you and me: Any male who is not circumcised will be cut off from his people<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> cut off from his people This means he must be separated from his family and lose his share of the inheritance.</span></a> because he has broken my agreement.” </div><div class='s'>Isaac—the Promised Son </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>God said to Abraham, “I will give Sarai,<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Sarai A name, probably Aramaic, meaning “princess.”</span></a> your wife, a new name. Her new name will be Sarah.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Sarah A Hebrew name meaning “princess.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will bless her. I will give her a son, and you will be the father. She will be the mother of many new nations. Kings of nations will come from her.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Abraham bowed his face to the ground to show he respected God. But he laughed and said to himself, “I am 100 years old. I cannot have a son, and Sarah is 90 years old. She cannot have a child.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then Abraham said to God, “I hope Ishmael will live and serve you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God said, “No, I said that your wife Sarah will have a son. You will name him Isaac.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Isaac This name means “he laughs” or “he is happy.”</span></a> I will make my agreement with him that will continue forever with all his descendants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“You mentioned Ishmael, and I heard you. I will bless him, and he will have many children. He will be the father of twelve great leaders. His family will become a great nation.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But I will make my agreement with Isaac, the son who Sarah will have. He will be born at this same time next year.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>After God finished talking with Abraham, God went up into heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Abraham gathered together Ishmael and all the slaves born in his house. He also gathered all the slaves he had bought. Every man and boy in Abraham’s house was gathered together, and they were all circumcised. Abraham circumcised them that day, just as God had told him to do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Ishmael, his son, was 13 years old when he was circumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Abraham and his son were circumcised on the same day.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Also, on that day all the men in Abraham’s house were circumcised. All the slaves born in his house and all the slaves he had bought were circumcised. </div><ul class='tnav'>
