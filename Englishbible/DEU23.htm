And none of his descendants to the tenth generation—may join in that group. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“An Ammonite or Moabite may not join with the men of Israel when they gather to worship the LORD. And none of their descendants, to the tenth generation, may join in the worship of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The Ammonites and Moabites refused to give you bread and water on your trip at the time you came from Egypt. They also tried to hire Balaam, the son of Beor from the Mesopotamian city of Pethor, to curse you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But the LORD your God refused to do what Balaam asked. Instead, the LORD changed the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loves you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You must never try to make peace with the Ammonites or Moabites. As long as you live, don’t be friendly to them. </div><div class='s'>People the Israelites Must Accept </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“You must not hate Edomites, because they are your relatives.

He must stay away from the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then, when evening comes, the man must bathe himself in water. And when the sun goes down, he may come into the camp again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“You also must have a place outside the camp where people can go to relieve themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Among your weapons, you must also carry a stick to dig with. Then, when you relieve yourself, you must dig a hole and cover it up.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>This is because the LORD your God is there with you in your camp to save you and to help you defeat your enemies. So the camp must be holy.

That money cannot be used to pay for a gift that was promised to the LORD your God, because that kind of sin is disgusting to him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“When you loan something to another Israelite, you must not charge interest. Don’t charge interest on money, on food or on anything that may earn interest.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You may charge interest to a foreigner. But you must not charge interest to another Israelite.
