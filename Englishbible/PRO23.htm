It might be a trick. </div><div class='s2'>— 7 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Don’t ruin your health trying to get rich. If you are smart, you will give it up.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In the blink of an eye, money can disappear, as if it grew wings and flew away like a bird. </div><div class='s2'>— 8 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Don’t eat with selfish people. Control any desire you have for their finest foods.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They might tell you to eat and drink all you want, but they don’t really mean it. They are the kind of people who are only thinking about the cost.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And if you eat their food, you will get sick and be embarrassed. </div><div class='s2'>— 9 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Don’t try to teach fools. They will make fun of your wise words. </div><div class='s2'>— 10 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Never move an old property line, and don’t take land that belongs to orphans.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Lord will be against you.

Let my life be your example.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Prostitutes and bad women are a trap. They are like a deep well that you cannot escape.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>A bad woman waits for you like a thief, and she causes many men to be unfaithful to their wives. </div><div class='s2'>— 18 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29-30&#160;</span>Who gets into fights and arguments?

It is pretty and red as it sparkles in the cup. And it goes down so smoothly when you drink it.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But in the end, it will bite like a snake. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Wine will cause you to see strange things and to say things that make no sense.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>When you lie down, you will think you are on a rough sea and feel like you are at the top of the mast.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>You will say, “They hit me, but I never felt it. They beat me, but I don’t remember it. Now I can’t wake up. I need another drink.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
