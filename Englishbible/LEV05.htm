People make many kinds of quick promises. You might make such a promise and forget it.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> forget it Literally, “it is hid from him.”</span></a> When you remember<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> remember Literally, “know of.”</span></a> your promise, you must pay a fine because you did not keep it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If you are guilty of any of these things, you must confess whatever you did wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then you must bring your guilt offering to the LORD for the sin you did. You must bring a female lamb or a female goat as a sin offering. The priest will do this to make you pure from your sin. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“If you cannot afford a lamb, you must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the LORD. These will be the guilt offering for your sin. One bird must be for a sin offering, and the other must be for a burnt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Take them to the priest. First, the priest will offer one bird for the sin offering. The priest will pull the bird’s head from its neck but he will not pull it off completely.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The priest will sprinkle the blood from the sin offering on the side of the altar. Then he will pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then he will offer the second bird according to the rules for a burnt offering. The priest will do this to make you pure from the sin you did, and God will forgive you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“If you cannot afford two doves or two pigeons, you must bring 8 cups<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> 8 cups Literally, “1/10 of an ephah” (2.2 l).</span></a> of fine flour as your sin offering. You must not put oil or frankincense on the flour because it is a sin offering.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You must bring the flour to the priest. The priest will take a handful of the flour as the memorial offering and bring it to the altar as a gift to the LORD. It is a sin offering.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The priest will do this to make you pure, and God will forgive you.

You might sin against me without meaning to by not giving what you promised. If you do that, you must bring a ram that has nothing wrong with it (or the same amount in silver using the official measure) as a guilt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>You must give what you promised and add one-fifth of that amount as a fine. Give it to the priest and he will use the ram to make you pure, and God will forgive you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“If you sin and break any of the commands that the LORD said must not be done, you are guilty.
