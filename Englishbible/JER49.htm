You will be punished.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The LORD says, “By my own power, I make this promise: I promise that the city of Bozrah will be destroyed. It will become a ruined pile of rocks. People will use it as an example when they ask for bad things to happen to other cities. People will insult that city, and all the towns around Bozrah will become ruins forever.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I heard a message from the LORD: </div><div class='q2'>He sent this messenger to the nations. </div><div class='q'>This is the message: </div><div class='q2'>“Gather your armies together! </div><div class='q'>Get ready for battle! </div><div class='q2'>March against the nation of Edom! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Edom, I will make you become unimportant. </div><div class='q2'>Everyone will hate you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Edom, you made other nations afraid, </div><div class='q2'>so you thought you were important. </div><div class='q'>But your pride has fooled you. </div><div class='q2'>You live in caves, high on the cliff. </div><div class='q2'>Your home is high in the hills. </div><div class='q'>But even if you build your home as high as an eagle’s nest, </div><div class='q2'>I will bring you down from there.” </div><div class='q'>This is what the LORD said. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Edom will be destroyed. </div><div class='q2'>People will be shocked to see the destroyed cities. </div><div class='q2'>They will whistle from amazement at the destroyed cities. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Edom will be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them. </div><div class='q2'>No one will live there.” </div><div class='q'>This is what the LORD said. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“Sometimes a lion will come from the thick bushes near the Jordan River.
