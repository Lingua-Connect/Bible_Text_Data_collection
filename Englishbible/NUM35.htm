This was in the Jordan Valley in Moab, near the Jordan River, across from Jericho. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Tell the Israelites that they should give some of the cities in their part of the land to the Levites. The Israelites should give these cities and the pastures around them to the Levites.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The Levites will be able to live in them. And all the cattle and other animals that belong to the Levites will be able to eat from the pastures around these cities.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span><span class='add'>How much of your land should you give to the Levites?</span> From the walls of the cities, go out 1500 feet<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 1500 feet Literally, “1000 cubits” (444 m). The people probably let their sheep and cattle use this land.</span></a>—all of that land will belong to the Levites.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Measure off an area around the city for the Levites. Start at the northeast corner and measure 3000 feet<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 3000 feet Literally, “2000 cubits” (1037 m). The Levites probably used this land for gardens and vineyards.</span></a> to the south. Then from this corner, measure 3000 feet to the west. From there measure 3000 feet to the north and from that corner, 3000 feet to the east. The city will be in the center of this area.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Six of those cities will be cities of safety. If a person accidentally kills someone, that person can run to those towns for safety. In addition to those six cities, you will also give 42 more cities to the Levites.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So you will give a total of 48 cities to the Levites. You will also give them the land around those cities.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The large tribes of Israel will get large pieces of land. The small tribes of Israel will get small pieces of land. So the large tribes will give more cities and the small tribes will give fewer cities to the Levites.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“Tell the people this: You will cross the Jordan River and go into the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>You must choose towns to be cities of safety. If someone accidentally kills another person, that person can run to one of those towns for safety.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>That person will be safe from anyone from the dead man’s family who wants to punish the killer until that person is judged in court.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>There will be six cities of safety.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Three of them will be east of the Jordan River and three of them will be in the land of Canaan, west of the Jordan River.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>These cities will be places of safety for citizens of Israel and for foreigners and travelers. Any of these people will be able to run to one of these cities if they accidentally kill someone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“If you use an iron weapon<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> iron weapon This shows that the murderer chose a weapon he knew could kill the other person.</span></a> to kill someone, you are a murderer, and you must die.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If you use a rock large enough to kill someone and you kill another person, you are a murderer, and you must die.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If you use a piece of wood large enough to kill someone and you kill another person, you are a murderer, and you must die.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A member of the dead person’s family<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> member of the dead person’s family Literally, “the blood avenger.” Also in verses 20-21, 24, 26-27.</span></a> can chase you and kill you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20-21&#160;</span>“You might hit someone with your hand or push someone or throw something at them and kill them.
