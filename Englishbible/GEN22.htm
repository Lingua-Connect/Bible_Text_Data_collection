<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='s'>Abraham, Kill Your Son </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After these things God decided to test Abraham’s faith. God said to him, “Abraham!” </div><div class='p'>And he said, “Yes!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then God said, “Take your son to the land of Moriah and kill your son there as a sacrifice for me. This must be Isaac, your only son, the one you love. Use him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains there. I will tell you which mountain.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>In the morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey. He took Isaac and two servants with him. He cut the wood for the sacrifice. Then they went to the place where God told them to go.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>After they traveled three days, Abraham looked up, and in the distance he saw the place where they were going.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then he said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go to that place and worship. Then we will come back to you later.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Abraham took the wood for the sacrifice and put it on his son’s shoulder. Abraham took the special knife and fire. Then both he and his son went together to the place for worship. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Isaac said to his father Abraham, “Father!” </div><div class='p'>Abraham answered, “Yes, son?” </div><div class='p'>Isaac said, “I see the wood and the fire. But where is the lamb we will burn as a sacrifice?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Abraham answered, “God himself is providing the lamb for the sacrifice, my son.” </div><div class='p'>So both Abraham and his son went together to that place.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When they came to the place where God told them to go, Abraham built an altar. He carefully laid the wood on the altar. Then he tied up his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Abraham reached for his knife to kill his son. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the angel of the LORD stopped him. The angel called from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” </div><div class='p'>Abraham answered, “Yes?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The angel said, “Don’t kill your son or hurt him in any way. Now I can see that you do respect and obey God. I see that you are ready to kill your son, your only son, for me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Abraham noticed a ram whose horns were caught in a bush. So Abraham went and took the ram. He offered it, instead of his son, as a sacrifice to God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Abraham gave that place a name, “The LORD Provides.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The LORD Provides Hebrew, “<span class='tl'>Yahweh Yireh</span>,” which can mean “the LORD sees” or “the LORD gives.”</span></a> Even today people say, “On the mountain of the LORD, he will give us what we need.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> On the mountain … need Or “On this mountain the LORD can be seen.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The angel said, “You were ready to kill your only son for me. Since you did this for me, I make you this promise: I, the LORD, promise that  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I will surely bless you and give you as many descendants as the stars in the sky. There will be as many people as sand on the seashore. And your people will live in cities that they will take from their enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Every nation on the earth will be blessed through your descendants. I will do this because you obeyed me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then Abraham went back to his servants. They all traveled back to Beersheba, and Abraham stayed there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>After all these things happened, a message was sent to Abraham. It said, “Your brother Nahor and his wife Milcah have children now.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The first son is Uz. The second son is Buz. The third son is Kemuel, the father of Aram.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then there are Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Bethuel was the father of Rebekah. Milcah was the mother of these eight sons, and Nahor was the father. Nahor was Abraham’s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Also Nahor had four other sons from his slave woman Reumah. The sons were Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
