I will destroy Egypt completely. The cities will be empty from Migdol to Aswan and as far as the border of Ethiopia.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>No person or animal will pass through Egypt. Nothing will pass through or settle there for 40 years.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will destroy Egypt. The cities will be in ruins for 40 years!

I will bring back the Egyptians to the land of Pathros, to the land where they were born. But their kingdom will not be important.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>It will be the least important kingdom. It will never again lift itself above the other nations. I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the family of Israel will never again depend on Egypt.

Every shoulder was rubbed bare from carrying heavy loads. Nebuchadnezzar and his army worked hard to defeat Tyre, but they got nothing from all that hard work.”  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So this is what the Lord GOD says: “I will give Egypt to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and he will carry away the people. He will take the many valuable things in Egypt to pay his army.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I will give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar as a reward for the hard work he did for me.” This is what the Lord GOD said! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“On that day I will make the family of Israel strong.
