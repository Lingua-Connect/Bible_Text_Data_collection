He traveled through the Negev with his wife and everything he owned. Lot was also with them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>At this time Abram was very rich. He had many animals and much silver and gold. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Abram continued traveling around. He left the Negev and went back to Bethel. He went to the place between the city of Bethel and Ai,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Ai The name of this town means “the ruins.”</span></a> where he and his family had camped before.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>This was where Abram had built an altar earlier. So he worshiped the LORD there. </div><div class='s'>Abram and Lot Separate </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>During this time Lot was also traveling with Abram. Lot had many animals and tents.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Abram and Lot had so many animals that the land could not support both of them together.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>(The Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in this land at the same time.) The shepherds of Abram and Lot began to argue. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Abram said to Lot, “There should be no arguing between you and me or between your people and my people. We are all brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>We should separate. You can choose any place you want. If you go to the left, I will go to the right. If you go to the right, I will go to the left.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Lot looked and saw the whole Jordan Valley. He saw that there was much water there. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. At that time the Jordan Valley all the way to Zoar was like the LORD’S Garden. This was good land, like the land of Egypt.)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So Lot chose to live in the Jordan Valley. The two men separated, and Lot began traveling east.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Abram stayed in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived among the cities in the valley. Lot moved as far as Sodom and made his camp there.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The LORD knew that the people of Sodom were very evil sinners. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>After Lot left, the LORD said to Abram, “Look around you. Look north, south, east, west.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All this land that you see I will give to you and your people who live after you. This will be your land forever.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will make your people so many that they will be like the dust of the earth. If people could count all the particles of dust on earth, they could count your people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So go. Walk through your land. I now give it to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So Abram moved his tents. He went to live near the big trees of Mamre. This was near the city of Hebron. There he built an altar to honor the LORD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
