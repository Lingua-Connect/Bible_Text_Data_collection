<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 23</div><div class='s'>David at Keilah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>People told David, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against the city of Keilah. They are robbing grain from the threshing floors.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>David asked the LORD, “Should I go and fight these Philistines?” </div><div class='p'>The LORD answered David, “Yes, go attack the Philistines. Save Keilah.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But David’s men said to him, “Look, our men are afraid here in Judah. Just think how afraid we will be if we go to Keilah, where the Philistine army is lined up and ready for battle.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>David again asked the LORD. And the LORD answered David, “Go down to Keilah. I will help you defeat the Philistines.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So David and his men went to Keilah. David’s men fought the Philistines. They defeated them and took their cattle. In this way David saved the people of Keilah.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>(When Abiathar ran away to David, Abiathar took an ephod with him.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> When Abiathar … him This means that Abiathar could go before God for David and ask for advice.</span></a>) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>People told Saul that David was now at Keilah. Saul said, “God has given David to me. David trapped himself when he went into a city surrounded by a wall with gates and bars to lock them.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Saul called all his army together for battle. They prepared to go down to Keilah to attack David and his men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>David learned that Saul was making plans against him. David then said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>David prayed, “LORD, God of Israel, I have heard that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town because of me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Will Saul come to Keilah? Will the people of Keilah give me to Saul? LORD, God of Israel, I am your servant. Please tell me!” </div><div class='p'>The LORD answered, “Saul will come.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Again David asked, “Will the people of Keilah give me and my men to Saul?” </div><div class='p'>The LORD answered, “They will.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So David and his men left Keilah. There were about 600 men who went with David. They kept moving from place to place. Saul learned that David had escaped from Keilah, so he did not go to that city. </div><div class='s'>Saul Chases David </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>David went into the desert of Ziph and stayed in the mountains and fortresses there. Saul looked for David the whole time, but the Lord<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> the Lord From the ancient Greek version and a Hebrew copy from Qumran. The standard Hebrew text has “God.”</span></a> didn’t let Saul catch him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>David was at Horesh in the desert of Ziph. He was afraid because Saul was coming to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Saul’s son Jonathan went to see David at Horesh and encouraged him to have a stronger faith in God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jonathan told David, “Don’t be afraid. My father Saul won’t hurt you. You will become the king of Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father knows this.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jonathan and David both made an agreement before the LORD. Then Jonathan went home, and David stayed at Horesh. </div><div class='s'>The People of Ziph Tell Saul <br/> About David </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Some people from Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and told him, “David is hiding in our area. He is at the fortresses of Horesh on Hakilah Hill, south of Jeshimon.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now, King, come down any time you want. It is our duty to give David to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Saul answered, “May the LORD bless you for helping me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Go and learn more about David. Keep track of where he goes and who goes to see him. I am told that David is smart and that he is trying to trick me.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Find all the hiding places that David uses. Then come back to me and tell me everything. Then I’ll go with you. If David is in the area, I will find him, even if I must go to every family group in Judah.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So those people went back to Ziph before Saul. </div><div class='p'>David and his men were in the desert of Maon, south of Jeshimon.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Saul and his men went to look for David, but the people warned him. They told David that Saul was looking for him. So David then went down to “The Rock” in the desert of Maon. Saul heard that David had gone there, so Saul went to that place to find him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Saul was on one side of the mountain. David and his men were on the other side of the same mountain. David was moving as quickly as possible to get away from Saul. But Saul and his soldiers were going around the mountain to cut them off and trap David and his men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then a messenger arrived and told Saul, “Come quickly! The Philistines are attacking.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Saul stopped chasing David and went to fight the Philistines. That is why people call this place “Slippery Rock.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Slippery Rock Or “Sela Hammahlekoth.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>David left the desert of Maon and went to the fortresses near En Gedi. </div><ul class='tnav'>
