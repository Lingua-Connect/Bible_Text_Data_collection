Abraham was very sad and cried for her there.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then he left his dead wife and went to talk to the Hittites. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“I am only a foreigner staying in your country. I have no place to bury my wife. Please give me some land so that I can bury her.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The Hittites answered Abraham,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“Sir, you are a great leader<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> great leader Literally, “God’s prince.”</span></a> among us. You can have the best place we have to bury your dead. You can have any of our burying places that you want. None of us will stop you from burying your wife there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Abraham got up and bowed to the people.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He said to them, “If you really want to help me bury my dead wife, speak to Ephron the son of Zohar for me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I would like to buy the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to Ephron. It is at the end of his field. I will pay him the full price. I want all of you to be witnesses that I am buying it as a burial place.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Ephron was sitting there among the people. He answered Abraham,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“No, sir. Here in front of my people, I give you that land and the cave on it so that you can bury your wife.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Abraham bowed before the Hittites.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He said to Ephron before all the people, “But I want to give you the full price for the field. Accept my money, and I will bury my dead.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Ephron answered Abraham,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“Sir, listen to me. Ten pounds<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Ten pounds Literally, “400 shekels” (4.6 kg). Also in verse 16.</span></a> of silver mean nothing to you or me. Take the land and bury your dead wife.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Abraham understood that Ephron was telling him the price of the land.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Abraham understood … the land Literally, “Abraham heard.”</span></a> So Abraham paid him for the land. He weighed out ten pounds of silver for Ephron and gave it to the merchant.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> merchant Someone who earns their living by buying and selling things. Here, this is probably a person who was helping Abraham and Ephron write the contract in verses 17 and 18.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17-18&#160;</span>So the field of Ephron changed owners. This field was in Machpelah, near Mamre. Abraham became the owner of the field, the cave in it, and all the trees in the field. Everyone in the city saw the agreement between Ephron and Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of that field near Mamre (Hebron) in the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Abraham bought the field and the cave in it from the Hittites. So this became his property to be used as a burial place. </div><ul class='tnav'>
