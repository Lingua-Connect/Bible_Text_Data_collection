I was happy and successful.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I had a dream that made me afraid. I was lying on my bed, and I saw pictures and visions in my mind. These things made me very afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So I gave an order that all the wise men of Babylon be brought to me to tell me what my dream meant.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When the men of magic and the Chaldeans came, I told them about the dream, but they could not tell me what it meant.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Finally, Daniel came to me. (I gave Daniel the name, Belteshazzar, to honor my god. The spirit of the holy gods is in him.) I told him about my dream.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I said, “Belteshazzar, you are the most important of all the men of magic. I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you. I know there is no secret that is too hard for you to understand. This was what I dreamed. Tell me what it means.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>These are the visions I saw while I was lying in my bed: I looked, and there in front of me was a tree standing in the middle of the earth. The tree was very tall.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The tree grew large and strong. The top of the tree touched the sky.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> middle of the earth … sky The Babylonians thought the earth was flat and round like a plate or a wheel. And they thought the sky was like a glass bowl turned upside down on the earth.</span></a> It could be seen from anywhere on earth.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The leaves of the tree were beautiful. It had much good fruit on it. And on the tree was plenty of food for everyone. The wild animals found shelter under the tree, and the birds lived in its branches. Every animal ate from the tree. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“I was looking at those things in the vision while lying on my bed. And then I saw a holy angel coming down from heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He spoke very loud and said, ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches. Strip off its leaves. Scatter its fruit around. The animals that are under the tree will run away. The birds that are in its branches will fly away.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But let the stump and roots stay in the ground. Put a band of iron and bronze around it. The stump and roots will stay in the field with the grass all around it. It will live among the wild animals and plants in the fields. It will become wet with dew.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He will not think like a man any longer. He will have the mind of an animal. Seven seasons will pass while he is like this.’ </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Holy angels announced this punishment so that all the people on earth may know that God Most High rules over human kingdoms. God gives those kingdoms to whoever he wants, and he chooses humble people to rule them. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“That is what I, King Nebuchadnezzar, dreamed. Now, Belteshazzar,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Belteshazzar Another name for Daniel.</span></a> tell me what it means. None of the wise men in my kingdom can tell me what that dream means. But Belteshazzar, you can interpret the dream because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) became very quiet for a while. What he was thinking bothered him. So the king said, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or its meaning make you afraid.” </div><div class='p'>Then Belteshazzar answered the king, “My lord, I wish the dream were about your enemies, and I wish the meaning of the dream were about those against you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20-21&#160;</span>You saw a tree in your dream. The tree grew large and strong. Its top touched the sky, and it could be seen from all over the earth. Its leaves were beautiful, and it had plenty of fruit. The fruit gave plenty of food for everyone. It was a home for the wild animals, and its branches were nesting places for the birds. You saw that tree.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>King, you are that tree! You have become great and powerful. You are like the tall tree that touched the sky—your power reaches to the far parts of the earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“King, you saw a holy angel coming down from heaven. He said, ‘Cut the tree down and destroy it. Put a band of iron and bronze around the stump and leave the stump and its roots in the ground. Leave it in the grass in the field. It will become wet with dew. He will live like a wild animal. Seven seasons will pass while he is like this.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>“King, this is the meaning of the dream. God Most High has commanded these things to happen to my lord the king:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>King Nebuchadnezzar, you will be forced to go away from people. You will live among the wild animals. You will eat grass like cattle, and you will become wet with dew. Seven seasons will pass, and then you will learn this lesson. You will learn God Most High rules over human kingdoms and gives them to whoever he wants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>“The command to leave the stump of the tree and its roots in the ground means this: Your kingdom will be given back to you. This will happen when you learn that Most High God rules your kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So, King, please accept my advice. Stop sinning and do what is right. Stop doing bad things and be kind to poor people. Then you might continue to be successful.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>All these things happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29-30&#160;</span>Twelve months after the dream, King Nebuchadnezzar was walking on the roof<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> roof In ancient Israel, houses had flat roofs that were used as an extra room.</span></a> of his palace in Babylon. While on the roof, the king said, “Look at Babylon! I built this great city. It is my palace. I built this great place by my power. I built this place to show how great I am.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The words were still in his mouth when a voice came from heaven. The voice said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, these things will happen to you: Your power as king has been taken away from you.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>You will be forced to go away from people. You will live with the wild animals and eat grass like an ox. Seven seasons will pass before you learn your lesson. Then you will learn that God Most High rules over human kingdoms and gives them to whoever he wants.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>These things happened immediately. Nebuchadnezzar was forced to go away from people. He began eating grass like an ox. He became wet from dew. His hair grew long like the feathers of an eagle, and his nails grew long like the claws of a bird. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then at the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up toward heaven, and I was in my right mind again. Then I gave praise to God Most High. I gave honor and glory to him who lives forever. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>God rules forever! </div><div class='q2'>His kingdom continues for all generations. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>People on earth </div><div class='q2'>are not really important. </div><div class='q'>God does what he wants </div><div class='q2'>with the powers of heaven </div><div class='q2'>and the people on earth. </div><div class='q'>No one can stop his powerful hand </div><div class='q2'>or question what he does. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>At that time God gave me my right mind again, and he gave back my great honor and power as king. My advisors and the royal people began to ask my advice again. I became the king again—even greater and more powerful than before.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, give praise, honor, and glory to the King of Heaven. Everything he does is right. He is always fair, and he is able to make proud people humble! </div><ul class='tnav'>
