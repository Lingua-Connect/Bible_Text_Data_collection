And he chose me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in the country of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If any of God’s people are living among you, I pray God will bless them. You must let them go to Jerusalem in the country of Judah. You must let them go build the Temple of the LORD, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And so in any place where there might be survivors of Israel, the men in that place must support these survivors. Give them silver, gold, animals, and other things. Give them gifts for God’s Temple in Jerusalem. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So the family leaders from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin prepared to go up to Jerusalem.

Also everyone who God had encouraged prepared to go to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>All their neighbors gave them many gifts. They gave them silver, gold, animals, and other expensive things. Their neighbors freely gave them all those things.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Also, King Cyrus brought out the things that belonged in the LORD’S Temple that Nebuchadnezzar had taken away from Jerusalem. He had put them in his temple where he kept his false gods.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>King Cyrus of Persia told Mithredath, the man who keeps his money, to bring those things out. So Mithredath brought them out to Sheshbazzar, the leader of Judah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This is what Mithredath brought out of the Lord’s Temple: 30 gold dishes, 1000 silver dishes, 29 knives and pans,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>30 gold bowls, 410 silver bowls similar to the gold bowls, and 1000 other dishes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All together, there were 5400 things made from gold and silver.
