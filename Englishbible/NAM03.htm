She used that water like a wall too.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Ethiopia and Egypt made Thebes strong. Libya and the Sudan supported her,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>but Thebes was defeated. Her people were taken away as prisoners to a foreign country. Soldiers beat her small children to death at every street corner. They threw lots to see who got to keep the important people as slaves. They put chains on all the important men of Thebes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So, Nineveh, you will also fall like a drunk. You will try to hide. You will look for a safe place away from the enemy.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Nineveh, all your strong places will be like fig trees. When new figs become ripe, people come and shake the tree. The figs fall into their mouths. They eat them, and the figs are gone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Nineveh, your people are all like women—and the enemy soldiers are ready to take them. The gates of your land are open wide for your enemies to come in. Fire has destroyed the wooden bars across the gates. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Get water and store it inside your city, because the enemy soldiers will surround your city. Make your defenses strong! Get clay to make more bricks and mix the mortar. Get the molds for making bricks.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You can do all these things, but the fire will still destroy you completely. And the sword will kill you. Your land will look like a swarm of grasshoppers came and ate everything. </div><div class='p'>Nineveh, you grew and grew. You became like a swarm of grasshoppers. You were like a swarm of locusts.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>You have many traders who go places and buy things. They are as many as the stars in the sky. They are like locusts that come and eat until everything is gone and then leave.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And your government officials are also like locusts that settle on a stone wall on a cold day. But when the sun comes up, the rocks become warm, and the locusts all fly away. And no one knows where. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>King of Assyria, your shepherds fell asleep. These powerful men are sleeping. And now your sheep have wandered away on the mountains. There is no one to bring them back.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Nineveh, you have been hurt badly, and nothing can heal your wound. Everyone who hears the news of your destruction claps their hands. They are all happy, because they all felt the pain you caused again and again. </div><ul class='tnav'>
