You must wear these things now and forever.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>You will be able to look at these tassels and remember all the commands that the LORD has given you.

You will not do wrong by forgetting about the commands and doing the things that your own bodies and eyes want.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>You will remember to obey all my commands. Then you will be God’s special people.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I am the LORD your God. I am the one who brought you out of Egypt. I did this to be your God.
