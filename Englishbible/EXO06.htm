I will use my great power against him, and he will let my people go. He will be so ready for them to leave that he will force them to go.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then God said to Moses, “I am the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They called me God All-Powerful. They did not know my name, the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I made an agreement with them. I promised to give them the land of Canaan. They lived in that land, but it was not their own.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now, I have heard their painful cries. I know that they are slaves in Egypt. And I remember my agreement.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So tell the Israelites that I say to them, ‘I am the LORD. I will save you. You will no longer be slaves of the Egyptians. I will use my great power to make you free, and I will bring terrible punishment to the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You will be my people and I will be your God. I am the LORD your God, and you will know that I made you free from Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I made a great promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I promised to give them a special land. So I will lead you to that land. I will give you that land. It will be yours. I am the LORD.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Moses told this to the Israelites, but the people would not listen to him.
