Israel, he made you, and now he says, “Don’t be afraid. I saved you. I named you. You are mine.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>When you have troubles, I am with you. When you cross rivers, you will not be hurt. When you walk through fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not hurt you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>That’s because I, the LORD, am your God. I, the Holy One of Israel, am your Savior. I gave Egypt to pay for you. I gave Ethiopia and Seba to make you mine.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You are precious to me, and I have given you a special place of honor. I love you. That’s why I am willing to trade others, to give up whole nations, to save your life. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“So don’t be afraid, because I am with you. I will gather your children and bring them to you. I will gather them from the east and from the west.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will tell the north: Give my people to me. I will tell the south: Don’t keep my people in prison. Bring my sons and daughters to me from the faraway places.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Bring to me all the people who are mine—the people who have my name. I made them for myself. I made them, and they are mine. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“Bring out the people who have eyes but are blind. Bring out the people who have ears but are deaf.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> blind … deaf This probably means the Israelites who would not believe God. See Isaiah 6:9-10.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>All people and all nations should also be gathered together. Which of their gods said this would happen? Which of their gods would tell what happened in the beginning? They should bring their witnesses. The witnesses should speak the truth. This will show they are right.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The LORD says, “You people are my witnesses and the servant I chose. I chose you so that you would help people believe me. I chose you so that you would understand that ‘I Am He’—<span class='add'>I am the true God</span>. There was no God before me, and there will be no God after me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I myself am the LORD, and there is no other Savior.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I am the one who spoke to you, saved you, and told you those things. It was not some stranger who was with you. You are my witnesses, and I am God.” (This is what the LORD himself said.)  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“I have always been God. When I do something, no one can change what I have done. And no one can save people from my power.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The LORD, the Holy One of Israel, saves you, and he says, “I will send armies to Babylon for you. Many people will be captured. Those Chaldeans will be taken away in their own boats. (They are so proud of those boats.)<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> I will send … boats Or with minor changes to the Hebrew, “I will send someone against Babylon to break open the gates, and the shouts of victory from the Chaldeans will be changed to crying.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I am the LORD your Holy One. I made Israel. I am your King.” </div><div class='s'>God Will Save His People Again </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The Lord is making roads through the sea. He is making a path for his people, even through rough waters. The LORD says,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Those who fight against me with their chariots, horses, and armies will be defeated. They will never rise again. They will be destroyed. They will be put out like the flame in a lamp.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So don’t remember what happened in earlier times. Don’t think about what happened a long time ago,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>because I am doing something new! Now you will grow like a new plant. Surely you know this is true. I will even make a road in the desert, and rivers will flow through that dry land.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The wild animals will thank me. The large animals and birds will honor me when I put water in the desert and make rivers flow through that dry land. I will do this to give water to my chosen people.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I made them, and they will sing songs of praise to me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“Jacob, you did not pray to me.

I did not force you to give gifts to me like slaves. I did not force you to burn incense until you became tired.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So you did not use your money to buy things to honor me. But you did force me to be like your slave. You sinned until the bad things you did made me very tired. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“I, I am the one who wipes away all your sins.
