Speak against the land of Israel for me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Say to the land of Israel, ‘This is what the LORD said: I am against you! I will pull my sword from its sheath. I will remove all people from you—the good and the evil.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will cut off both good people and evil people from you. I will pull my sword from its sheath and use it against all people from south to north.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then everyone will know that I am the LORD. They will know that I have pulled my sword from its sheath. My sword will not go back into its sheath again until it is finished.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“Son of man, make sad sounds like a sad person with a broken heart. Make these sad sounds in front of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then they will ask you, ‘Why are you making these sad sounds?’ Then you must say, ‘Because of the sad news that is coming. Every heart will melt with fear. All hands will become weak. Every spirit will become weak. All knees will be like water.’ Look, that bad news is coming. These things will happen!” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='s'>The Sword Is Ready </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The word of the LORD came to me.

He said,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“Son of man, draw two roads that the sword of the king of Babylon can use to come to Israel. Both roads will come from the same country. Then draw a sign at the head of the road to the city.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Use the sign to show which road the sword will use. One road leads to the Ammonite city of Rabbah. The other road leads to Judah, to the protected city, Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The king of Babylon has come to where the two roads separate. He uses magic to learn which way to go: He shakes his arrows, he asks his family idols, and he looks at the liver<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> arrows, idols, liver People who believed in false gods used these things to try to learn the future.</span></a> from an animal he has killed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“The signs tell him to take the road on his right, the road leading to Jerusalem, where he will use battering rams.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> battering rams Heavy logs that soldiers used to break holes into the gates or walls around a city.</span></a> The signs tell him to give the command for his soldiers to begin the killing. They will shout the battle cry and set the battering rams against the gates. They will build a wall of dirt around the city and a dirt road leading up to the walls. They will build wooden towers to attack the city.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the people in Jerusalem will think this is all a big mistake. They will not believe that this could happen, because they had made a peace agreement with Babylon’s king. But the king will remind them that they are guilty of breaking that agreement, and he will take them captive.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: “You have done many evil things. Your sins are very clear. You forced me to remember that you are guilty, so the enemy will catch you in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And you, evil leader of Israel, you will be killed. Your time of punishment has come! The end is here!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: “Take off the turban! Take off the crown! The time has come to change. The important leaders will be brought low, and those who are not important now will become important leaders.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I will completely destroy that city! But this will not happen until the right man becomes the new king. Then I will let him have this city.” </div><div class='s'>The Ammonites Punished </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“Son of man, speak to the people for me.
