He ruled 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Amaziah did what the LORD said was right, but he did not follow God completely like David his ancestor. Amaziah did everything that Joash his father had done.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He did not destroy the high places. The people still sacrificed and burned incense at those places of worship. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>At the time that Amaziah had strong control of the kingdom, he killed the officers who had killed his father.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But he did not kill the children of the murderers because of the rules written in the book, <span class='bk'>The Law of Moses</span>. The LORD gave this command in there: “Parents must not be put to death for something their children did. And children must not be put to death for something their parents did. People should be put to death only for what that they themselves did.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Parents must … did See Deuteronomy 24:16.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Amaziah killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. In war, Amaziah took Sela and called it “Joktheel.” It is still called “Joktheel” today. </div><div class='s'>Amaziah Wants War Against Jehoash </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, son of King Jehu of Israel. Amaziah’s message said, “Come on, let’s meet together face to face and fight.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>King Jehoash of Israel sent an answer to King Amaziah of Judah. Jehoash said, “The thornbush in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar tree in Lebanon. It said, ‘Give your daughter for my son to marry.’ But a wild animal from Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thornbush.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>True, you have defeated Edom. But you have become proud because of your victory over Edom. But stay at home and brag! Don’t make trouble for yourself. If you do this, you will fall, and Judah will fall with you!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But Amaziah would not listen to Jehoash’s warning. So King Jehoash of Israel went to fight against King Amaziah of Judah at Beth Shemesh in Judah.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> King Jehoash … Judah Literally, “He and King Amaziah of Judah looked at each other in the face at Beth Shemesh in Judah.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Israel defeated Judah. Every man of Judah ran home.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>At Beth Shemesh, King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah. Jehoash took Amaziah to Jerusalem. Jehoash broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, about 600 feet.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> about 600 feet Literally, “400 cubits” (177.6 m).</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Jehoash took all the gold and silver and all the dishes in the LORD’S Temple and in the treasures of the king’s palace. Jehoash also took people to be his prisoners. Then he went back to Samaria. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All the great things that Jehoash did, including how he fought against King Amaziah of Judah, are written in the book, <span class='bk'>The History of the Kings of Israel</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jehoash died and was buried with his ancestors. He was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Jehoash’s son Jeroboam became the new king after him. </div><div class='s'>The Death of Amaziah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah lived 15 years after the death of King Jehoash son of Jehoahaz of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>All the great things that Amaziah did are written in the book, <span class='bk'>The History of the Kings of Judah</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The people made a plan against Amaziah in Jerusalem, so he ran away to Lachish. But the people sent men after Amaziah to Lachish, and they killed him there.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The people brought Amaziah’s body back on horses. He was buried at Jerusalem with his ancestors in the City of David. </div><div class='s'>Azariah Begins His Rule Over Judah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then all the people of Judah made Azariah the new king. Azariah was 16 years old.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So King Amaziah died and was buried with his ancestors. Then Azariah rebuilt Elath and got it back for Judah. </div><div class='s'>Jeroboam II Begins His Rule Over Israel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>King Jeroboam son of Jehoash of Israel began to rule in Samaria during the 15th year that Amaziah son of Joash was king of Judah. Jeroboam ruled 41 years.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jeroboam did what the LORD said was wrong. He did not stop committing the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Jeroboam took back Israel’s land, which ran from the Lebo Hamath to the Arabah Sea.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Arabah Sea The Dead Sea.</span></a> This happened as the LORD of Israel had told his servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath Hepher.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The LORD saw that all the Israelites, both slaves and free men, had many troubles. No one was left who could help Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The LORD did not say that he would take away the name of Israel from the world.
