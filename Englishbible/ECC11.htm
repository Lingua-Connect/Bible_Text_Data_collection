If clouds are full of rain, they will pour water on the earth. If a tree falls—to the south or to the north—then it will stay where it falls. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But there are some things that you cannot be sure of. You must take a chance. If you wait for perfect weather, you will never plant your seeds. If you are afraid that every cloud will bring rain, you will never harvest your crops. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You don’t know where the wind blows. And you don’t know how a baby grows in its mother’s womb. In the same way, you don’t know what God will do—and he makes everything happen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So begin planting early in the morning, and don’t stop working until evening.
