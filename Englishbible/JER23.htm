But I will take care of you—I will punish you for the evil things you did.” This message is from the LORD:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“I sent my sheep to other countries. But I will gather together my sheep that are left, and I will bring them back to their pasture. When my sheep are back in their pasture, they will have many children and grow in number.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will place new shepherds over my sheep.
