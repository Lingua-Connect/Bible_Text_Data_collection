I looked up and saw four chariots going between two bronze mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Red horses were pulling the first chariot. Black horses were pulling the second chariot.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>White horses were pulling the third chariot, and horses with red spots were pulling the fourth chariot.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I asked the angel who was talking with me, “Sir, what does this mean?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The angel said, “These are the four winds.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> four winds Or “four spirits.” Four winds often means “winds that blow from every direction: north, south, east, and west.”</span></a> They have just come from the Lord of the whole world.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The black horses will go north, the red horses will go east, the white horses will go west, and the horses with red spots will go south.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The red spotted horses were anxious to go look at their part of the earth, so the angel told them, “Go walk through the earth.” So they went walking through their part of the earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he shouted at me and said, “Look, those horses that were going north finished their job <span class='add'>in Babylon</span>.

Get silver and gold from these men and then go to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Use the silver and gold to make a crown.
