You must take some of the first crops you gather and put them in baskets. Then take that part of your harvest to the place that the LORD your God chooses to be the home for his name.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Go to the priest who is serving at that time.

They hurt us and forced us to work very hard.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then we prayed to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, and complained about them. And the LORD heard us. He saw our trouble, our hard work, and our suffering.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his great power and strength. He used great miracles and wonders and did amazing things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So he brought us to this place.
