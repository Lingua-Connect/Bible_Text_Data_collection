They watched me write those words.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then I went to my wife, the woman prophet. She became pregnant and had a son. The LORD told me, “Name the boy Maher Shalal Hash Baz.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He said that because before the boy learns to say “Mama” and “Daddy,” God will take all the wealth and riches from Damascus<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Damascus A city in the country of Aram (Syria).</span></a> and Samaria and give them to the king of Assyria. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The LORD spoke to me again.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He said, “These people<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> These people Probably Judeans who wanted to join Rezin and Pekah.

The Assyrians will come like their swift moving river, like water that rises and spills over its banks.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This water will be like a flash flood as it passes through Judah. It will rise to Judah’s throat and almost drown him. </div><div class='p'>But he will spread his wings over your whole country, Immanuel.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> But he … Immanuel Or “Immanuel, it will spread throughout your whole country.” This might be a promise of God’s protection, or it might be a warning about Assyria’s power.</span></a> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>All you nations, prepare for war. </div><div class='q2'>You will be defeated. </div><div class='q'>Listen, all you faraway countries! </div><div class='q2'>Prepare for battle. </div><div class='q2'>You will be defeated. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Make your plans for the fight. </div><div class='q2'>Your plans will be defeated. </div><div class='q'>Give orders to your armies, </div><div class='q2'>but your orders will be useless, </div><div class='q2'>because God is with us!<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> God is with us In Hebrew this is like the name Immanuel.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Warnings to Isaiah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The LORD spoke to me with his great power and warned<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> warned Or “prevented.”</span></a> me not to be like these people. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“Don’t think there is a plan against you just because the people say there is. Don’t be afraid of what they fear. Don’t let them frighten you!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful is the one you should fear.
