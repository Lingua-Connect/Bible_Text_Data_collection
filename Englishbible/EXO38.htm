This was the altar used for burning offerings. The altar was square. It was 5 cubits<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 5 cubits 8' 6” (2.6 m). Also in verse 18.</span></a> long, 5 cubits wide, and 3 cubits<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 3 cubits 5' 1 3/16” (1.55 m).</span></a> high.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He made a horn for each of the four corners of the altar. He joined each horn to its corner so that everything was one piece. He covered the altar with bronze.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then he used bronze to make all the tools to be used on the altar. He made the pots, shovels, bowls, forks, and pans.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then he made a bronze grating for the altar. This grating was shaped like a net. The grating was put under the ledge at the bottom of the altar. It went halfway up into the altar from below.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then he made bronze rings to hold the poles for carrying the altar. He put the rings at the four corners of the grating.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then he used acacia wood to make the poles and covered them with bronze.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it. He used boards to make the sides of the altar. It was hollow, like an empty box. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He made the bowl and its base with bronze.
