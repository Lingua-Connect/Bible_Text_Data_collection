<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 43</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So Jeremiah finished telling the people the message from the LORD their God. He told them everything that the LORD their God had sent him to tell them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and some other men were proud and stubborn. They became angry with Jeremiah. They said to him, “Jeremiah, you are lying! The LORD our God didn’t send you to say to us, ‘You must not go to Egypt to live there.’  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jeremiah, we think that Baruch son of Neriah is encouraging you to be against us. He wants you to give us to the Babylonians. He wants you to do this so they can kill us. Or he wants you to do this so that they can make us captives and take us to Babylon.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Johanan, the army officers, and all the people disobeyed the LORD’S command. The Lord had commanded them to stay in Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But Johanan, son of Kareah, and the army officers did not obey this command. Instead, they took the survivors from Judah to Egypt. In the past the enemy had taken the survivors to other countries, but they had come back to Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now Johanan and all the army officers took all the men, women, and children and led them to Egypt. Among those people were the king’s daughters. (Nebuzaradan had put Gedaliah in charge of those people. Nebuzaradan was the commander of the king of Babylon’s special guards.) Johanan also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>These people didn’t listen to the LORD. So they all went to Egypt to the town of Tahpanhes.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Tahpanhes A town in northeastern Egypt.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In the town of Tahpanhes, Jeremiah received this message from the LORD:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Jeremiah, get some large stones. Take them and bury them in the clay and brick sidewalk in front of Pharaoh’s official building in Tahpanhes. Do this while the people of Judah are watching you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then say to those who are watching you: ‘This is what the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, says: I will send for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to come here. He is my servant, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here. Nebuchadnezzar will spread his canopy<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> canopy A temporary covering used for shade. It is like a tent without sides.</span></a> above these stones.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He will come here and attack Egypt. He will bring death to those who are to die. He will bring captivity to those who are to be taken captive. And he will bring the sword to those who are to be killed with a sword.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Nebuchadnezzar will start a fire in the temples of the false gods of Egypt. He will burn the temples and he will take the idols away. Shepherds pick the bugs and thorns off their clothes to make them clean. In the same way Nebuchadnezzar will pick Egypt clean. Then he will safely leave Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He will destroy the memorial stones that are in the temple of the Sun God<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Sun God This was the most important god in Egypt.</span></a> in Egypt, and he will burn down the temples of the false gods of Egypt.’ ” </div><ul class='tnav'>
