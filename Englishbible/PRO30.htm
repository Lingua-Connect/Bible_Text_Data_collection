He says, “God, I am tired, so tired. How can I keep going?”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> He says, “God, … keep going?” Or “This is his message to Ithiel and Ucal.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I am stupid. I am not as smart as other people are.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I have not learned to be wise. I know nothing about the Holy One.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Holy One Literally, “the holy ones.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who has ever gone up to heaven and come back down? Who gathered the winds in his hand? Who can gather up all the water in his lap? Who set the limits for the world? What is his name, and what is his son’s name? Do you know? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You can trust this: Every word that God speaks is true. God is a safe place for those who go to him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So don’t try to change what God says. If you do, he will punish you and prove that you are a liar. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>God, I ask you to do two things for me before I die.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Don’t let me tell lies. And don’t make me too rich or too poor—give me only enough food for each day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If I have too much, I might deny that I need you, LORD. But if I am too poor, I might steal and bring shame to the name of my God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Never say bad things about a slave to his master. If you do, he will curse you, and you will suffer for it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Some people curse their fathers and refuse to bless their mothers. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Some people think they are pure, but they have done nothing to remove the filth of their sin. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Some people are so proud of themselves, and they look down on everyone else. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>There are people whose teeth are like swords and their jaws like knives.
