<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='s'>The New Beginning </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Have many children. Fill the earth with your people.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Every animal on earth, every bird in the air, every animal that crawls on the ground, and every fish in the sea will be afraid of you. All of them will be under your control.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>In the past, I gave you the green plants to eat. Now every animal will also be food for you. I give you everything on earth—it is yours.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But I give you one command. You must not eat meat that still has its life (blood) in it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Also, I will demand your blood for your lives. That is, I will demand the life of any person or animal that takes a human life. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“God made humans to be like himself. </div><div class='q2'>So whoever kills a person must be killed by another person. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“Have many children and fill the earth with your people.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then God said to Noah and his sons,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“I now make my promise to you and to your people who will live after you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I make my promise to all the birds, and to all the cattle, and to all the animals that came out of the boat with you. I make my promise to every living thing on earth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This is my promise to you: All life on the earth was destroyed by the flood. But that will never happen again. A flood will never again destroy all life on the earth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And God said, “I will give you something to prove that I made this promise to you. It will continue forever to show that I have made an agreement with you and every living thing on earth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I am putting a rainbow in the clouds as proof of the agreement between me and the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When I bring clouds over the earth, you will see the rainbow in the clouds.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When I see this rainbow, I will remember the agreement between me and you and every living thing on the earth. This agreement says that a flood will never again destroy all life on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When I look and see the rainbow in the clouds, I will remember the agreement that continues forever. I will remember the agreement between me and every living thing on the earth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So God said to Noah, “This rainbow is proof of the agreement that I made with all living things on earth.” </div><div class='s'>Problems Begin Again </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Noah’s sons came out of the boat with him. Their names were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>These three men were Noah’s sons. And all the people on earth came from these three sons. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>One day Noah made some wine. He got drunk, went into his tent, and took off all his clothes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ham, the father of Canaan, saw that his father was naked and told his brothers who were outside the tent.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Shem and Japheth took a robe, put it across their shoulders, and walked backward into the tent. Then they covered their father without looking at him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Later, Noah woke up. (He was sleeping because of the wine.) When he learned what his youngest son Ham had done to him,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>he said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“May there be a curse on Canaan<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Canaan Ham’s son.
