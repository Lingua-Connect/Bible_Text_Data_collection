Rezin was the king of Aram, Pekah son of Remaliah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Pekah son of Remaliah A king of northern Israel. He ruled about 740-731 B.C.</span></a> was the king of Israel. When Ahaz was king of Judah, Rezin and Pekah went up to Jerusalem to attack it, but they were not able to defeat the city.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Rezin and Pekah … the city Or “Rezin and Pekah went up to attack Jerusalem, but they were not able to fight.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The family of David received a message that said, “The armies of Aram and Ephraim have joined together in one camp.” When King Ahaz heard this message, he and the people became frightened. They shook with fear like trees of the forest blowing in the wind. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then the LORD told Isaiah, “You and your son Shear Jashub<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Shear Jashub This is a name that means “a few people will come back.”</span></a> should go out and talk to Ahaz. Go to the place where the water flows into the Upper Pool,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Upper Pool Probably the Pool of Siloam at the southern tip of the City of David, just above the older pool now called the Red Pool.</span></a> on the street that leads up to Laundryman’s Field. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“Tell Ahaz, ‘Be careful, but be calm. Don’t be afraid. Don’t let those two men, Rezin and Remaliah’s son,<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Remaliah’s son Pekah, the king of northern Israel. He ruled about 740–731 B.C.</span></a> frighten you! They are like two burning sticks. They might be hot now, but soon they will be nothing but smoke. Rezin, Aram, and Remaliah’s son became angry  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and made plans against you. They said,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“Let’s go fight against Judah and divide it among ourselves. Then we will make Tabeel’s son the new king of Judah.” ’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But the Lord GOD says, “Their plan will not succeed. It will not happen  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>because Aram depends on its capital Damascus, and Damascus is led by its weak king Rezin. And don’t worry about Ephraim. Within 65 years it will be crushed, no longer a nation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Ephraim depends on its capital Samaria, and Samaria is led by Remaliah’s son. So you have no reason to fear. Believe this, or you will not survive.” </div><div class='s'>Immanuel—God Is With Us </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the LORD spoke to Ahaz again  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and said, “Ask for a sign from the LORD your God to prove to yourself that this is true. You can ask for any sign you want. The sign can come from a place as deep as Sheol<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The sign … Sheol Or “Make your request deep.” The Hebrew word for “question” is like the word for Sheol.</span></a> or as high as the skies.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> The sign … skies Literally, “make your request very high.”</span></a>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Ahaz said, “I will not ask for a sign as proof. I will not test the LORD.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Isaiah said, “Family of David, listen very carefully! Is it not enough that you would test the patience of humans? Will you now test the patience of my God?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the Lord will still show you this sign: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>The young woman is pregnant<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> And here … pregnant Or “Look at this young woman.
