He will be treated like a son and get a share of the inheritance. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Fire is used to make gold and silver pure, but a person’s heart is made pure by the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>People who do evil listen to evil ideas. Liars listen to liars. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Whoever makes fun of beggars insults their Maker. Whoever laughs at someone else’s trouble will be punished. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Grandchildren are the pride and joy of old age, and children take great pride in their parents. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You wouldn’t expect to hear a fine speech from a fool, and you shouldn’t expect lies from a ruler. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Some people think a bribe is like a lucky charm—it seems to work wherever they go. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Forgive someone, and you will strengthen your friendship. Keep reminding them, and you will destroy it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Smart people learn more from a single correction than fools learn from a hundred beatings. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Those who are evil only want to cause trouble. In the end, punishment without mercy will be sent to them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It is better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool who is busy doing foolish things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If you do wrong to those who were good to you, you will have trouble the rest of your life. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The start of an argument is like a small leak in a dam. Stop it before a big fight breaks out. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The LORD hates these two things: punishing the innocent and letting the guilty go free. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Money is wasted on fools.
