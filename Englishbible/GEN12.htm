<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='s'>God Calls Abram </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The LORD said to Abram, “Leave your country and your people. Leave your father’s family and go to the country that I will show you. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will build a great nation from you. </div><div class='q2'>I will bless you </div><div class='q2'>and make your name famous. </div><div class='q'>People will use your name </div><div class='q2'>to bless other people. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I will bless those who bless you, </div><div class='q2'>and I will curse those who curse you. </div><div class='q'>I will use you to bless </div><div class='q2'>all the people on earth.” </div><div class='s'>Abram Goes to Canaan </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Abram left Haran just like the LORD said, and Lot went with him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the slaves, and all the other things he had gotten in Haran. Then he and his group moved to the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Abram traveled through the land as far as the town of Shechem and then to the big tree at Moreh. The Canaanites were living in the land at that time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The LORD appeared<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The LORD appeared God often used special shapes so that people could see him. Sometimes he was like a man, an angel, a fire, or a bright light.</span></a> to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your descendants.” </div><div class='p'>Abram built an altar to honor the LORD who appeared to him there.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he left that place and traveled to the mountains east of Bethel. He set up his tent there. Bethel was to the west, and Ai<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Ai The name of this town means “the ruins.”</span></a> was to the east. Abram built another altar at that place to honor the LORD, and he worshiped the LORD there.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then he moved on toward the Negev, stopping for a time at several places on the way. </div><div class='s'>Abram in Egypt </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>During this time there was not enough food in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Just before they arrived in Egypt, Abram told Sarai, “Look, I know that you are a very beautiful woman.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When the Egyptian men see you, they will say, ‘This woman is his wife.’ Then they will kill me and keep you alive because they want you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So tell them that you are my sister. Then they will be good to me because of you. In this way you will save my life.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So when Abram went into Egypt, the Egyptian men saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Even some of Pharaoh’s officials noticed her and told Pharaoh how beautiful she was. So they took her to Pharaoh’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Pharaoh was kind to Abram because he thought Abram was Sarai’s brother. He gave Abram sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and men and women servants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Pharaoh took Abram’s wife, so the LORD caused Pharaoh and all the people in his house to have very bad diseases.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Pharaoh called Abram and said to him, “You have done a very bad thing to me! Why didn’t you tell me Sarai was your wife?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You said, ‘She is my sister.’ Why did you say that? I took her so that she could be my wife, but now I give your wife back to you. Take her and go!”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh commanded his men to lead Abram out of Egypt. So Abram and his wife left that place and took everything they had with them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
