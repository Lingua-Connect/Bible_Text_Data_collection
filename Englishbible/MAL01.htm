Servants honor their masters. I am your Father, so why don’t you honor me? I am your master, so why don’t you respect me? You priests don’t respect my name. </div><div class='p'>“But you say, ‘What have we done that shows we don’t respect your name?’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“You bring unclean bread to my altar. </div><div class='p'>“But you ask, ‘What makes that bread unclean?’ </div><div class='p'>“It is unclean because you show no respect for the altar of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You bring blind animals as sacrifices, and that is wrong. You bring sick and crippled animals for sacrifices, and that is wrong. Try giving those sick animals as a gift to your governor. Would he accept those sick animals? No, he would not accept them.” This is what the LORD All-Powerful said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Now try asking God to be good to you.

All around the world they bring good gifts to me and burn good incense as a gift to me, because my name is important to all of them.” This is what the LORD All-Powerful said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“But you people show that you don’t respect my name. You say that the Lord’s altar is unclean. And you don’t like the food from that altar.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You smell the food and refuse to eat it. You say it is bad. Then you bring sick, crippled, and hurt animals to me. You try to give sick animals to me as sacrifices, but I will not accept them.” This is what the LORD All-Powerful said.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“Some people have good, male animals that they could give as sacrifices, but don’t. Some people bring good animals and promise to give those healthy animals to me. But then they secretly exchange those good animals and give me sick animals instead. Bad things will happen to those people. I am the Great King and people all around the world respect me!” This is what the LORD All-Powerful said. </div><ul class='tnav'>
