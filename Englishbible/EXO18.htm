<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='s'>Advice From Moses’ Father-in-Law </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, was a priest in Midian. He heard about the many ways that God helped Moses and the Israelites. He heard about the LORD leading the Israelites out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So Jethro went to Moses while Moses was camped near the mountain of God.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> mountain of God That is, Mount Horeb (Sinai).</span></a> Jethro brought Moses’ wife, Zipporah, with him. (Zipporah was not with Moses, because Moses had sent her home.)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jethro also brought Moses’ two sons with him. The first son was named Gershom,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gershom This name is like the Hebrew words meaning “a stranger there.”</span></a> because when he was born, Moses said, “I am a stranger in a foreign country.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The other son was named Eliezer,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Eliezer This name means “My God helps.”</span></a> because when he was born, Moses said, “The God of my father helped me and saved me from the king of Egypt.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So Jethro went to Moses while Moses was camped in the desert near the mountain of God. Moses’ wife and his two sons were with Jethro. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jethro sent a message to Moses that said, “This is your father-in-law Jethro. I am bringing your wife and her two sons to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law. Moses bowed down before him and kissed him. The two men asked about each other’s health. Then they went into Moses’ tent to talk more.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Moses told Jethro everything the LORD had done for the Israelites. He told what the Lord did to Pharaoh and the people of Egypt. He told about all the problems they had along the way. And he told his father-in-law how the LORD saved the Israelites every time there was trouble. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jethro was happy when he heard all the good things the LORD had done for Israel. He was glad that the Lord had freed the Israelites from the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Praise the LORD! </div><div class='q2'>He freed you from the power of Egypt. </div><div class='q2'>He saved you from Pharaoh. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now I know the LORD is greater than all the gods. </div><div class='q'>They thought they were in control, but look what God did!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Jethro got some sacrifices and offerings to honor God. Then Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat with Moses’ father-in-law Jethro. They all ate together there with God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The next day, Moses had the special job of judging the people. There were so many people that they had to stand before him all day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jethro saw Moses judging the people. He asked, “Why are you doing this? Why are you the only judge? And why do people come to you all day?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Moses said to his father-in-law, “The people come to me and ask me to ask for God’s decision for their problem.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If people have an argument, they come to me, and I decide which person is right. In this way I teach the people God’s laws and teachings.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “This isn’t the right way to do this.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>It is too much work for you to do alone. You cannot do this job by yourself. It wears you out. And it makes the people tired too.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now, listen to me. Let me give you some advice. And I pray God will be with you. You should continue listening to the problems of the people. And you should continue to speak to God about these things.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You should explain God’s laws and teachings to the people. Warn them not to break the laws. Tell them the right way to live and what they should do.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But you should also choose some of the people to be judges and leaders. </div><div class='p'>“Choose good men you can trust—men who respect God. Choose men who will not change their decisions for money. Make these men rulers over the people. There should be rulers over 1000 people, 100 people, 50 people, and even over ten people.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let these rulers judge the people. If there is a very important case, then they can come to you and let you decide what to do. But they can decide the other cases themselves. In this way these men will share your work with you, and it will be easier for you to lead the people.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If you do this as God directs you, then you will be able to do your job without tiring yourself out. And the people can still have all their problems solved before they return home.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Moses did what Jethro told him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Moses chose good men from among the Israelites. He made them leaders over the people. There were rulers over 1000 people, 100 people, 50 people, and ten people.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>These rulers were judges for the people. The people could always bring their arguments to these rulers, and Moses had to decide only the most important cases. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>After a short time Moses said goodbye to his father-in-law Jethro, and Jethro went back to his own home. </div><ul class='tnav'>
