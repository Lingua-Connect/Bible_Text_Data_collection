He scatters dill seeds, he throws cumin seeds on the ground, and he plants wheat in rows. A farmer plants barley in its special place, and he plants spelt seeds at the edge of his field. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Our God is using this to teach you a lesson.

No, and he doesn’t use a wagon to crush cumin seeds. A farmer uses a small stick to break the hulls from these seeds of grain.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>People grind grain to make flour, but they don’t grind it forever. As God does in punishing people, a worker might drive his wagon over the grain to remove the hulls, but he does not allow the horses<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> horses This word also means “horse soldiers.”</span></a> to crush it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>This lesson comes from the LORD All-Powerful, who gives wonderful advice.
