Don’t be happy. You acted like a prostitute and left your God. You committed your sexual sin<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> You committed your sexual sin This means the people were not faithful to God. But it also means the people had sexual relations with temple prostitutes.

There will not be enough wine for Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The Israelites will not stay in the LORD’S land. Ephraim will return to Egypt. In Assyria they will eat food that they should not eat.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They will not be able to give offerings of wine to the LORD. None of their sacrifices will please him. What they offer will be like food eaten at a funeral—whoever eats it will become unclean. They can eat that food for their own hunger, but it cannot be taken into the Lord’s Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They will not be able to celebrate the LORD’S feasts or festivals.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Literally, “What will you do for a day of solemn assembly, for the LORD’S festival day?”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The people of Israel left because the enemy took everything from them. But Egypt will take the people themselves. Memphis<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Memphis An important city in Egypt.</span></a> will bury them. Weeds will grow over their silver treasures, and thorns will grow where the Israelites lived. </div><div class='s'>Israel Rejected the True Prophets </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The prophet says, “Israel, learn this: The time of punishment has come. The time has come for you to pay for the evil things you did.” But the people of Israel say, “The prophet is a fool. This man with <span class='add'>God’s</span> Spirit is crazy.” The prophet says, “You will be punished for your terrible sins. You will be punished for your hate.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>God and the prophet are like guards watching over Ephraim, but there are many traps along his way. And people hate the prophet, even in the house of his God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The Israelites have gone deep into ruin as in the time of Gibeah. God will remember the Israelites’ sins, and he will punish them. </div><div class='s'>Israel Is Ruined by Its Worship of Idols </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“At the time I, the Lord, found Israel, they were like fresh grapes in the desert.
