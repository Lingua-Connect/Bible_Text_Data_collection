<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='s'>The Lampstand and the Two Olive Trees </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then the angel who was talking to me returned and woke me up. I was like a person waking up from sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then the angel asked me, “What do you see?” </div><div class='p'>I said, “I see a solid gold lampstand. There are seven lamps<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> lamps These lamps made light by burning olive oil.</span></a> on the lampstand, and there is a bowl on top of it. There are seven tubes coming from the bowl. One tube goes to each lamp. <span class='add'>The tubes bring the oil in the bowl to each of the lamps.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>There are two olive trees by the bowl, one on the right side and one on the left side. <span class='add'>These trees produce the oil for the lamps.</span>”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “Sir, what do these things mean?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The angel speaking with me said, “Don’t you know what these things are?” </div><div class='p'>“No sir,” I said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He said, “This is the message from the LORD to Zerubbabel: ‘Your help will not come from your own strength and power. No, your help will come from my Spirit.’ This is what the LORD All-Powerful says.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>That tall mountain will be like a flat place for Zerubbabel. He will build the Temple, and when the most important stone is put in place, the people will shout, ‘Beautiful! Beautiful!’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The LORD’S message to me also said,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Zerubbabel will lay the foundations for my Temple, and he will finish building it. Then you will know that the LORD All-Powerful sent me to you people.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>People will not be ashamed of the small beginnings, and they will be very happy when they see Zerubbabel with the plumb line,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> plumb line A string with a weight on one end used to show how straight the walls of a building were.

Now the seven sides<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> sides This is a wordplay.

They see everything on earth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then I said to him, “I saw one olive tree on the right side of the lampstand and one on the left side. What do those two olive trees mean?”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I also said to him, “I saw two olive branches by the gold tubes with gold colored oil flowing from them. What do these things mean?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then the angel said to me, “Don’t you know what these things mean?” </div><div class='p'>I said, “No, sir.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So he said, “They represent the two men chosen<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> men chosen Literally, “sons of extra pure olive oil.” Often a special oil was poured over new kings, priests, and prophets. This showed that these people were chosen by God.</span></a> to serve the Lord of the whole world.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
