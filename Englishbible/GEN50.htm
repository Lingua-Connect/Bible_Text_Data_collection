<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 50</div><div class='s'>Jacob’s Funeral </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When Israel died, Joseph was very sad. He hugged his father and cried over him and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Joseph commanded his servants to prepare his father’s body. (These servants were doctors.) The doctors prepared Jacob’s body to be buried. They prepared the body in the special way of the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When the Egyptians prepared the body in this special way, they waited 40 days before they buried the body. Then the Egyptians had a special time of sadness for Jacob. This time was 70 days. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>After the time of sadness was finished, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s officers and said, “Please tell this to Pharaoh:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>‘When my father was near death, I made a promise to him. I promised that I would bury him in a cave in the land of Canaan. This is the cave that he prepared for himself. So please let me go and bury my father. Then I will come back here to you.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Pharaoh answered, “Keep your promise. Go and bury your father.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So Joseph went to bury his father. All of Pharaoh’s officials, personal advisors, and all the older leaders of Egypt went with Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>All the people in Joseph’s family, his brothers, and all the people in his father’s family went with him. Only the children and the animals stayed in the land of Goshen.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So there was a large crowd of people with him. There was even a group of soldiers riding in chariots and some on horses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They went to Goren Atad,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Goren Atad Or “Atad’s threshing floor.”</span></a> east of the Jordan River. There they had a long funeral service for Israel, which continued for seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When the people who lived in Canaan saw the funeral service at Goren Atad, they said, “This is a time of great sorrow for those Egyptians.” So now that place across the Jordan River is named Abel Mizraim.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Abel Mizraim This means “Egyptian time of sadness.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So Jacob’s sons did what their father told them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They carried his body to Canaan and buried it in the cave at Machpelah. This was the cave near Mamre in the field that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite. Abraham bought that cave to use as a burial place.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>After Joseph buried his father, he and everyone in the group with him went back to Egypt. </div><div class='s'>The Brothers Are Still Afraid of Joseph </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>After Jacob died, Joseph’s brothers were worried. They were afraid that Joseph would still be mad at them for what they had done years before. They said, “Maybe Joseph still hates us for what we did.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the brothers sent this message to Joseph: “Before your father died, he told us to give you a message.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He said, ‘Tell Joseph that I beg him to please forgive his brothers for the bad things they did to him.’ So now Joseph, we beg you, please forgive us for the bad things we did to you. We are the servants of God, the God of your father.” </div><div class='p'>That message made Joseph very sad, and he cried.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>His brothers went to him and bowed down in front of him. They said, “We will be your servants.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. I am not God! I have no right to punish you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>It is true that you planned to do something bad to me. But really, God was planning good things. God’s plan was to use me to save the lives of many people. And that is what happened.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So don’t be afraid. I will take care of you and your children.” And so Joseph said kind things to his brothers, and this made them feel better. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Joseph continued to live in Egypt with his father’s family. He died when he was 110 years old.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>During Joseph’s life Ephraim had children and grandchildren. And his son Manasseh had a son named Makir. Joseph lived to see Makir’s children. </div><div class='s'>The Death of Joseph </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When Joseph was near death, he said to his brothers, “My time to die is almost here. But I know that God will take care of you and lead you out of this country. God will lead you to the land he promised to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Joseph asked his people to make a promise. Joseph said, “Promise me that you will carry my bones with you when God leads you out of Egypt.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Joseph died in Egypt when he was 110 years old. Doctors prepared his body for burial and put the body in a coffin in Egypt. </div><ul class='tnav'>
