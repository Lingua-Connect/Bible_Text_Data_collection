His long robe filled the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Seraph angels stood around him. Each angel had six wings. They used two wings to cover their faces, two wings to cover their bodies, and two wings to fly.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The angels were calling to each other, “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD All-Powerful. His Glory fills the whole earth.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The sound was so loud that it caused the frame around the door to shake, and the Temple was filled with smoke.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> smoke This showed that God was in the Temple. See Exodus 40:34-35.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I was frightened and said, “Oh, no! I will be destroyed.

One of the Seraph angels used a pair of tongs to take a hot coal from the fire. Then the angel flew to me with it in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then he touched my mouth with the hot coal and said, “When this hot coal touched your lips, your guilt was taken away, and your sins were erased.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> erased Or “atoned” or “covered over.”</span></a>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Who can I send? Who will go for us?” </div><div class='p'>So I said, “Here I am. Send me!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the Lord said, “Go and tell the people, ‘Listen closely, but don’t understand. Look closely, but don’t learn.’  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Confuse them. Make them unable to understand what they hear and see. If you don’t do this, they might really look with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their minds. Then they might come back to me and be healed!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then I asked, “Lord, how long should I do this?” </div><div class='p'>He answered, “Do this until the cities are destroyed and all the people are gone.

They will be like an oak tree. When the tree is chopped down, a stump is left. This stump will be a very special seed that will grow again. </div><ul class='tnav'>
