This was 480 years after the Israelites left Egypt.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 480 years … Egypt This was about 960 B.C.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The Temple was 60 cubits<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 60 cubits 102' 3/8” (31.1 m).</span></a> long, 20 cubits<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> 20 cubits 34' 1/8” (10.37 m).

The ancient Greek version has “25 cubits.”</span></a> high.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The porch of the Temple was 20 cubits long and 10 cubits<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 10 cubits 17' 1/16” (5.18 m). Also in verses 23, 24-26.</span></a> wide. The porch ran along the front of the main part of the Temple itself. Its length was equal to the width of the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>There were narrow windows in the Temple. These windows were smaller on the inside of the wall than on the outside.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> These windows … outside Or “These windows had lattice work over them.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Solomon built a row of rooms around the main part of the Temple. This row of rooms was three stories tall with the rooms built one above the other.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The rooms touched the Temple wall, but their beams were not built into that wall. The Temple wall became thinner at the top, so the rooms on the upper floors were larger than the ones below them. The rooms on the bottom floor were 5 cubits<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> 5 cubits 8' 6” (2.6 m). Also in verses 10, 24-26.</span></a> wide. The rooms on the middle floor were 6 cubits<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 6 cubits 10' 2 7/16” (3.11 m).</span></a> wide. The rooms above that were 7 cubits<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 7 cubits 11' 10 13/16” (3.63 m).</span></a> wide.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The stones were completely finished before they were brought into the Temple area, so there was no noise of hammers, axes, or any other iron tools in the Temple. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The entrance to these rooms was on bottom floor at the south side of the Temple. Inside there were stairs that went up to the second floor and from there to the third floor. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Solomon finished building the main part of the Temple and then covered it inside with cedar boards.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then he finished building the rooms around the Temple. Each story was 5 cubits tall. The cedar beams in these rooms rested on a ledge of the Temple wall. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The LORD said to Solomon,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“If you obey all my laws and commands, I will do for you what I promised your father David.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I will live among the children of Israel in this Temple that you are building, and I will never leave the people of Israel.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When Solomon finished the stonework on the Temple,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>the stone walls inside the Temple were covered with cedar boards from floor to ceiling. Then the stone floor was covered with pine boards.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They built an inner room 20 cubits long in the back part of the Temple. This room was called the Most Holy Place. They covered the walls in this room with cedar boards, from floor to ceiling.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In front of the Most Holy Place was the main part of the Temple. This room was 40 cubits<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 40 cubits 68' 1/4” (20.73 m).</span></a> long.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They covered the walls in this room with cedar boards—none of the stones in the walls could be seen. They carved pictures of flowers and gourds into the cedar. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Solomon finished the inner room in the back part of the Temple. This room was for the Box of the LORD’S Agreement  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This room was 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 20 cubits high. Solomon covered this room with pure gold. He also covered the cedar altar with gold.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He covered the inside of the Temple with pure gold and wrapped gold chains around it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The inside of the Temple was covered with gold, and the altar in front of the Most Holy Place was covered with gold. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The workers made two statues of Cherub angels with wings.

From the end of one wing to the end of the other wing was 10 cubits. And each Cherub angel was 10 cubits tall.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They put the Cherub angels beside one another in the Most Holy Place. Their wings touched each other in the middle of the room. The other two wings touched each side wall.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The two Cherub angels were covered with gold. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The walls around the main room and the inner room were carved with pictures of Cherub angels, palm trees, and flowers.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The floor of both rooms was covered with gold. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The workers made two doors from olive wood.

Then they covered the doors with gold. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They also made doors for the entrance to the main room. They used olive wood to make a square doorframe.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>There were two doors made from pine. Each door had two parts that folded together.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>They carved pictures of Cherub angels, palm trees, and flowers on the doors. Then they covered them with gold. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then they built a wall around the inner yard.
