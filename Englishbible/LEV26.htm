The land will grow crops and the trees of the field will grow their fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Your threshing will continue until it is time to gather grapes. And your grape gathering will continue until it is time to plant. Then you will have plenty to eat. And you will live safely in your land.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will give peace to your country. You will lie down in peace. No one will come to make you afraid.

I will stop smelling your offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I will make your land empty. And your enemies who come to live there will be shocked at it.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>I will scatter you among the nations. I will pull out my sword and destroy you.

They will be afraid of everything. They will run around like a leaf blown by the wind. They will run as if someone is chasing them with a sword. They will fall even when no one is chasing them.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They will run as if someone is chasing them with a sword. They will fall over each other—even when no one is chasing them. </div><div class='p'>“You will not be strong enough to stand up against your enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>You will be lost in other nations.

I will remember my agreement with Isaac. I will remember my agreement with Abraham, and I will remember the land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>“The land will be empty. The land will enjoy its time of rest. Then the survivors will accept the punishment for their sins.

I will listen to them, even if they are in the land of their enemies. I will not completely destroy them. I will not break my agreement with them, because I am the LORD their God.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For them, I will remember the agreement with their ancestors. I brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt so that I could become their God. The other nations saw these things.
