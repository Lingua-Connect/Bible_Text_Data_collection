<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='s'>The Potter and the Clay </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Jeremiah, go down to the potter’s house. I will give you my message there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So I went down to the potter’s house and saw him working with clay at the wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He was making a pot from clay. But there was something wrong with the pot. So the potter used that clay to make another pot. With his hands he shaped the pot the way he wanted it to be. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then this message from the LORD came to me:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“Family of Israel, you know that I can do the same thing with you. You are like the clay in the potter’s hands, and I am the potter.” This message is from the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“There may come a time when I will speak about a nation or a kingdom that I will pull up by its roots or tear down and destroy it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But if the people of that nation change their hearts and lives and stop doing evil things, I will change my mind and not bring on them the disaster I planned.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There may come another time when I speak about a nation that I will build up or plant.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But if I see that nation doing evil things and not obeying me, I will think again about the good I had planned to do for them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“So, Jeremiah, say to the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am the potter preparing troubles for you and making plans against you. So stop doing the evil things you are doing. Each person must change and start doing good.’  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But the people of Judah will answer, ‘We don’t care what you say. We will continue to do what we want. We will do the evil our stubborn hearts want.’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Listen to what the LORD says: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Ask the other nations this question: </div><div class='q2'>‘Have you ever heard of anything so bad?’ </div><div class='q'>Israel, who is as dear to me as a young daughter, </div><div class='q2'>has done this terrible thing! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>It is as strange as not finding snow on Lebanon’s mountains </div><div class='q2'>or seeing the cool streams that come from there stop flowing. </div><div class='q2'>That just does not happen! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But my people have forgotten me. </div><div class='q2'>They burn offerings to worthless idols. </div><div class='q'>They have left the right way that their ancestors followed, </div><div class='q2'>and they stumble on the path they have chosen. </div><div class='q'>Instead of staying on the good road I showed them, </div><div class='q2'>they prefer to walk on bumpy paths. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So their land will become an empty desert, </div><div class='q2'>a place for people from now on to make fun of. </div><div class='q'>All who pass by there will be shocked by what has happened. </div><div class='q2'>They will just shake their heads at what they see. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Like a strong east wind, I will scatter my people. </div><div class='q2'>I will use their enemies to scatter them like dust. </div><div class='q'>When disaster comes upon them, </div><div class='q2'>they will see me leaving, not coming to help.” </div><div class='s'>The People Plan Evil and Jeremiah Prays </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then the enemies of Jeremiah said, “Come, let us make plans against Jeremiah. We will always have a priest to tell us what the law says. We will still have wise men to advise us and prophets to tell us a message from God. So who needs Jeremiah? Let’s tell lies to ruin him and stop listening to what he says.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>LORD, listen to me! </div><div class='q2'>Listen to what my enemies are saying. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I have done only good to them. </div><div class='q2'>It is not right for them to pay me back with evil. </div><div class='q2'>But they are preparing a death trap for me! </div><div class='q'>Remember that I prayed to you for them. </div><div class='q2'>I asked only good for them. </div><div class='q2'>I tried to keep you from punishing them in anger. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So now make their children starve to death! </div><div class='q2'>Let their enemies kill them with swords. </div><div class='q'>Let their wives lose their children and husbands. </div><div class='q2'>Let their men die from disease, </div><div class='q2'>and let their young men be killed in battle. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let them cry out in their houses, </div><div class='q2'>when you suddenly bring an enemy against them. </div><div class='q'>Let it happen because they prepared a death trap for me. </div><div class='q2'>They hid traps for me to step in. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>LORD, you know about their plans to kill me. </div><div class='q2'>So don’t forgive their crimes or erase their sins. </div><div class='q'>Make them fall down in defeat. </div><div class='q2'>Punish them in your anger! </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
