This is what the Lord GOD says to the hills and mountains and to the ravines and valleys: Look! I am bringing the enemy to fight against you. I will destroy your high places.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Your altars will be broken into pieces. Your incense altars will be smashed, and I will throw down your dead bodies in front of your filthy idols.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I will put the dead bodies of the people of Israel in front of their filthy idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Bad things will happen wherever your people live. Their cities will become piles of rock. Their high places will be destroyed so that those places of worship will never be used again. The altars will all be destroyed. People will never worship those filthy idols again. The incense altars will be smashed. Everything you made will be destroyed completely.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your people will be killed, and then you will know that I am the LORD!’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>God said, “But I will let a few of your people escape.

I broke their spirit.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> spirit Literally, “heart.”</span></a> They will hate themselves for the evil things they did. In the past, they turned away from me and left me. They chased after their filthy idols. They were like a woman leaving her husband and running off with another man. They did many terrible things,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>but they will learn that I am the LORD. Then they will know that if I say that I will do something, I will do it! They will know that I caused all the troubles that happened to them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then the Lord GOD said to me, “Clap your hands and stamp your feet. Speak against all the terrible things that the people of Israel have done. Warn them that they will be killed by disease and hunger. Tell them they will be killed in war.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>People far away will die from disease. People near this place will be killed with swords, and those who are left in the city will starve to death. Only then will I stop being angry.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Only then will you know that I am the LORD.
