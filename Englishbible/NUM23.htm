<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 23</div><div class='s'>Balaam’s First Message </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Balaam said, “Build seven altars here. And prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Balak did what Balaam asked. Then Balak and Balaam killed a ram and a bull on each of the altars. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here near this altar. I will go to another place. Then the LORD will come to me, and he will tell me what I must say.” Then Balaam went away to a higher place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>God came to Balaam at that place, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars. And I have killed a bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the LORD gave Balaam a message for Balak and said, “Go back to Balak and say the things that I have given you to say.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Balaam went back to Balak. Balak was still standing near the altar, and all the leaders of Moab were standing there with them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Balaam spoke, and this was his message: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Balak, the king of Moab, </div><div class='q2'>brought me here from the eastern mountains of Aram. </div><div class='q'>Balak said to me, </div><div class='q2'>‘Come, curse Jacob for me. </div><div class='q2'>Come, speak against the Israelites.’ </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But God is not against them, </div><div class='q2'>so I cannot speak against them either! </div><div class='q'>The LORD has not asked for bad things to happen to these people. </div><div class='q2'>So I cannot do that either. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I see these people from the mountain. </div><div class='q2'>I see them from the high hills. </div><div class='q'>They live alone. </div><div class='q2'>They are not part of another nation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who can count Jacob’s people? </div><div class='q2'>They are as many as the grains of dust. </div><div class='q2'>No one can count even a fourth of the Israelites. </div><div class='q'>Let me die like a good man. </div><div class='q2'>Let my life end as happy as theirs!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Balaam answered, “I must say the things that the LORD tells me to say.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Balak said to him, “So come with me to another place. At that place you can see more of these people. You cannot see all of them—you can only see part of them. Maybe from that place you can curse them for me.”  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Balak led Balaam to Watchmen Hills.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Watchmen Hills Or “the fields of Zophim.”</span></a> This was on top of Mount Pisgah. There Balak built seven altars and killed a bull and a ram on each altar as a sacrifice. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here by this altar while I go meet with God over there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the LORD came to Balaam and told Balaam what to say. Then he told Balaam to go back to Balak and say these things.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So Balaam went to Balak. Balak was still standing near the altar. The leaders of Moab were there with him. Balak saw Balaam coming and said, “What did the LORD say?” </div><div class='s'>Balaam’s Second Message </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then Balaam said this: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Stand up, Balak, and listen to me. </div><div class='q2'>Hear me, Balak son of Zippor. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God is not a man; </div><div class='q2'>he will not lie. </div><div class='q'>God is not a human being; </div><div class='q2'>his decisions will not change. </div><div class='q'>If he says he will do something, </div><div class='q2'>then he will do it. </div><div class='q'>If he makes a promise, </div><div class='q2'>then he will do what he promised. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He told me to bless them. </div><div class='q2'>He blessed them, so I cannot change that. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>God saw no wrong in Jacob’s people. </div><div class='q2'>He saw no sin in the Israelites. </div><div class='q'>The LORD is their God, </div><div class='q2'>and he is with them. </div><div class='q2'>The Great King is with them! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>God brought them out of Egypt. </div><div class='q2'>They are as strong as a wild ox. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There is no power that can defeat the people of Jacob. </div><div class='q2'>There is no magic that can stop the Israelites. </div><div class='q'>People will say this about Jacob and the Israelites: </div><div class='q2'>‘Look at the great things God did!’<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or “There is no fortunetelling in Jacob, no magic in Israel.

Maybe God will be pleased and will allow you to curse them from that place.”  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Balak led Balaam to the top of Mount Peor, which looks out over the desert. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Balaam said, “Build seven altars here. Then prepare seven bulls and seven rams for the altars.”  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Balak did what Balaam asked.
