<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 47</div><div class='s'>Israel Settles in Goshen </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Joseph went in to Pharaoh and said, “My father and my brothers and all their families are here. They have all their animals and everything they own from the land of Canaan with them. They are now in the land of Goshen.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Joseph chose five of his brothers to be with him before the Pharaoh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Pharaoh said to the brothers, “What work do you do?” </div><div class='p'>The brothers said to Pharaoh, “Sir, we are shepherds, just as our ancestors were shepherds before us.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They said to Pharaoh, “The famine is very bad in Canaan. There are no fields left with grass for our animals, so we have come to live in this land. We ask you to please let us live in Goshen.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You can choose any place in Egypt for them to live. Give your father and your brothers the best land. Let them live in the land of Goshen. And if they are skilled shepherds, they can also care for my cattle.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Joseph called his father Jacob to come in to meet Pharaoh. Jacob blessed Pharaoh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh said to him, “How old are you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jacob said to Pharaoh, “I have had a short life with many troubles. I am only 130 years old. My father and his ancestors lived to be much older than I am.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left from his meeting with him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Joseph did what Pharaoh said and gave his father and brothers land in Egypt. It was the best land in Egypt, in the eastern part of the country, around Rameses.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Joseph also gave his father, his brothers, and all their people the food they needed. </div><div class='s'>Joseph Buys Land for Pharaoh </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The famine got worse; there was no food anywhere in the land. Egypt and Canaan became very poor because of this bad time.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>People in the land bought more and more grain. Joseph saved the money and brought it to Pharaoh’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>After some time, the people in Egypt and Canaan had no money left. They had spent all their money to buy grain. So the people of Egypt went to Joseph and said, “Please give us food. Our money is gone. If we don’t eat, we will die while you are watching.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Joseph answered, “Give me your cattle, and I will give you food.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So the people used their cattle and horses and all their other animals to buy food. And that year, Joseph gave them food and took their animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But the next year the people had no animals and nothing to buy food with. So they went to Joseph and said, “You know that we have no money left, and all our animals belong to you. So we have nothing left—only what you see—our bodies and our land.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Surely we will die while you are watching. But if you give us food, we will give Pharaoh our land, and we will be his slaves. Give us seed so that we can plant. Then we will live and not die, and the land will grow food for us again.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. All the people in Egypt sold Joseph their fields. They did this because they were very hungry.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And everywhere in Egypt all the people became Pharaoh’s slaves.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The only land Joseph didn’t buy was the land that the priests owned. The priests didn’t need to sell their land because Pharaoh paid them for their work. So they used this money to buy food to eat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Joseph said to the people, “Now I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. So I will give you seed, and you can plant your fields.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>At harvest time, you must give one-fifth of your crops to Pharaoh. You can keep four-fifths for yourselves. You can use the seed you keep for food and planting the next year. Now you can feed your families and your children.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The people said, “You have saved our lives. We are happy to be slaves to Pharaoh.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So Joseph made a law at that time in the land, and that law continues today. The law says that one-fifth of everything from the land belongs to the Pharaoh who owns all the land. The only land he does not own is the land of the priests. </div><div class='s'>Don’t Bury Me in Egypt </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Israel stayed in Egypt. He lived in the land of Goshen. His family grew and became very large. They became landowners there and did very well. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years, so he was 147 years old.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The time came when Israel knew he would soon die, so he called his son Joseph to him. He said, “If you love me, put your hand under my leg and make a promise.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> put your hand … make a promise This was a sign of a very important promise that Jacob trusted Joseph to keep.</span></a> Promise that you will do what I say and that you will be truthful with me. When I die, don’t bury me in Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Bury me in the place where my ancestors are buried. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in our family grave.” </div><div class='p'>Joseph answered, “I promise that I will do what you say.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Jacob said, “Make a vow to me.” And Joseph vowed to him that he would do this. Then Israel laid his head back down on the bed.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Then Israel … on the bed Or “Then Israel bowed down at the head of his bed” or “Then Israel worshiped on the head of the staff.”</span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
