So Rachel said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I will die!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, “I am not God. He is the one who has caused you to not have children.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Rachel said, “You can have my maid Bilhah. Sleep with her, and she will have a child for me.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> she will have a child for me Literally, “she will give birth on my knees, and I, too, will have a son through her.”</span></a> Then I can be a mother through her.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Rachel gave Bilhah to her husband Jacob. He had sexual relations with Bilhah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>She became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Jacob. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Rachel said, “God has listened to my prayer. He decided to give me a son.” So she named this son Dan.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Dan This is like the Hebrew word meaning “to decide” or “to judge.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Bilhah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a second son.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Rachel said, “I have fought hard to compete with my sister, and I have won.” So she named that son Naphtali.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Naphtali This is like the Hebrew word meaning “my struggle.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Leah saw that she could have no more children. So she gave her slave girl Zilpah to Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Zilpah had a son.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Leah said, “I am lucky.” So she named the son Gad.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gad This is like the Hebrew word meaning “lucky” or “fortunate.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Zilpah gave birth to another son.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Leah said, “I am very happy! Now women will call me happy.” So she named that son Asher.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Asher This is like the Hebrew word meaning “blessed” or “happy.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>During the wheat harvest Reuben went into the fields and found some special flowers.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> special flowers Or “mandrakes.” The Hebrew word means “love plant.” People thought these plants could help women have babies.</span></a> He brought them to his mother Leah. But Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s flowers.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Leah answered, “You have already taken away my husband.

Leah saw him and went out to meet him. She said, “You will sleep with me tonight. I have paid for you with my son’s flowers.” So Jacob slept with Leah that night. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then God allowed Leah to become pregnant again. She gave birth to a fifth son.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>She said, “God has given me a reward because I gave my slave to my husband.” So she named her son Issachar.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Issachar This is like the Hebrew word meaning “reward” or “salary.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>She said, “God has given me a fine gift. Now surely Jacob will accept me, because I have given him six sons.” So she named this son Zebulun.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Zebulun This is like the Hebrew word meaning “praise” or “honor.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Later, Leah gave birth to a daughter. She named her Dinah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then God heard Rachel’s prayer and made it possible for Rachel to have children.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, “God has taken away my shame.”  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Rachel named the son Joseph,<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Joseph This is like the Hebrew word meaning “to add.”</span></a> saying, “May the Lord give me another son.” </div><div class='s'>Jacob Tricks Laban </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>After the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Now let me go back to my own homeland.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Give me my wives and my children. I have earned them by working for you. You know that I served you well.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Laban said to him, “Please, let me say something. I know<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> know Or “guessed,” “divined,” or “concluded.”</span></a> that the LORD has blessed me because of you.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Tell me what I should pay you, and I will give it to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jacob answered, “You know that I have worked hard for you. Your flocks have grown and been well while I cared for them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When I came, you had little. Now you have much, much more. Every time I did something for you, the LORD blessed you. Now it is time for me to work for myself—it is time to do things for my family.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Laban asked, “Then what should I give you?” </div><div class='p'>Jacob answered, “I don’t want you to give me anything! I only want you to let me do this one thing: I will go back and take care of your sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But let me go through all your flocks today and take every lamb with spots or stripes. Let me take every black young goat and every female goat with stripes or spots. That will be my pay.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>In the future you can easily see if I am honest. You can come to look at my flocks. If I have any goat that isn’t spotted or any sheep that isn’t black, you will know that I stole it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Laban answered, “I agree to that. We will do what you ask.”  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But that day Laban hid all the male goats that had spots. And he hid all the female goats that had spots on them. He also hid all the black sheep. Laban told his sons to watch these sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So the sons took all the spotted animals and led them to another place. They traveled for three days. Jacob stayed and took care of all the animals that were left. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then Jacob cut green branches from poplar and almond trees. He stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>He put the branches in front of the flocks at the watering places. When the animals came to drink, they also mated in that place.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then when the goats mated in front of the branches, the young that were born were spotted, striped, or black. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Jacob separated the spotted and the black animals from the other animals in the flock. He kept his animals separate from Laban’s.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Any time the stronger animals in the flock were mating, Jacob put the branches before their eyes. The animals mated near those branches.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But when the weaker animals mated, Jacob did not put the branches there. So the young animals born from the weak animals were Laban’s. And the young animals born from the stronger animals were Jacob’s.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>In this way Jacob became very rich. He had large flocks, many servants, camels, and donkeys. </div><ul class='tnav'>
