<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 20</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Wine and beer make people lose control; they get loud and stumble around. And that is foolish. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>An angry king is like a roaring lion. If you make him angry, you could lose your life. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>People who refuse to argue deserve respect. Any fool can start an argument. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Some people are too lazy to plant seeds. So at harvest time, they look for food and find nothing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Getting information from someone can be like getting water from a deep well. If you are smart, you will draw it out. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You might call many people your “friends,” but it is hard to find someone who can really be trusted. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When people live good, honest lives, their children are blessed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When the king sits and judges people, he must look carefully to separate the evil from the good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Can anyone say their heart is pure? Who can say, “I am free from sin”? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The LORD hates for people to use the wrong weights and measures to cheat others. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Even children show what they are like by the things they do. You can see if their actions are pure and right. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It was the LORD who gave us eyes for seeing and ears for hearing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If you love to sleep, you will become poor. Use your time working and you will have plenty to eat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When buying something, people always say, “It’s no good. It costs too much.” Then they go away and tell others what a good deal they got. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The right knowledge can bring you gold, pearls, and other expensive things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If someone promises to pay the debt of a stranger, get a coat or something from him to keep until the debt is paid. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>It may seem to be a good thing to get something by cheating, but in the end, it will be worth nothing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Get good advice when you make your plans. Before you start a war, find good advisors. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You cannot trust someone who would talk about things told in private. So don’t be friends with someone who talks too much. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Those who would curse their father or mother are like a lamp that goes out on the darkest night. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If your wealth was easy to get, it will not be worth much to you.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or “An inheritance greedily guarded in the beginning will not be blessed in the end.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Don’t ever say, “I’ll pay them back for what they did to me!” Wait for the LORD. He will make things right. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The LORD hates for people to use the wrong weights to cheat others.
