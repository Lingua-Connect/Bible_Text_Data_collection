<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 29</div><div class='s'>Jacob Meets Rachel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Jacob continued his trip. He went to the country in the East.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He looked and saw a well in the field. There were three flocks of sheep lying near the well, where the sheep drank water. There was a large rock covering the mouth of the well.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the rock away from the well. Then all the sheep could drink from the water. After the sheep were full, the shepherds would put the rock back in its place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jacob said to the shepherds there, “Brothers, where are you from?” </div><div class='p'>They answered, “We are from Haran.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Jacob said, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?” </div><div class='p'>The shepherds answered, “We know him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Jacob said, “How is he?” </div><div class='p'>They answered, “He is well. Look, that is his daughter Rachel coming now with his sheep.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jacob said, “Look, it is still day and long before the sun sets. It is not yet time for the animals to be gathered together for the night. So give them water and let them go back into the field.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But they said, “We cannot do that until all the flocks are gathered together. Then we will move the rock from the well, and all the sheep will drink.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>While Jacob was talking with the shepherds, Rachel came with her father’s sheep. (It was her job to take care of the sheep.)  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Rachel was Laban’s daughter. Laban was the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s mother. When Jacob saw Rachel, he went and moved the rock and gave water to the sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and cried.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He told her that he was from her father’s family. He told her that he was the son of Rebekah. So Rachel ran home and told her father. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran to meet him. Laban hugged him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban everything that had happened. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Laban said, “This is wonderful! You are from my own family.” So Jacob stayed with Laban for a month. </div><div class='s'>Laban Tricks Jacob </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>One day Laban said to Jacob, “You are a relative of mine. It is not right for you to continue working for me without pay. What should I pay you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Now Laban had two daughters. The older was Leah and the younger was Rachel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Leah’s eyes were gentle,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Leah’s eyes were gentle This might be a polite way of saying Leah was not very pretty.</span></a> but Rachel was beautiful.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jacob loved Rachel, so he said to Laban, “I will work seven years for you if you will allow me to marry your daughter Rachel.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Laban said, “It would be better for her to marry you than someone else. So stay with me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So Jacob stayed and worked for Laban for seven years. But it seemed like a very short time because he loved Rachel very much. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>After seven years Jacob said to Laban, “Give me Rachel so that I can marry her. My time of work for you is finished.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Laban gave a party for all the people in that place.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>That night Laban brought his daughter Leah to Jacob. Jacob and Leah had sexual relations together.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>(Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter to be her maid.)  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In the morning Jacob saw that it was Leah he had slept with, and he said to Laban, “You have tricked me. I worked hard for you so that I could marry Rachel. Why did you trick me?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Laban said, “In our country we don’t allow the younger daughter to marry before the older daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Continue for the full week of the marriage ceremony, and I will also give you Rachel to marry. But you must serve me another seven years.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Jacob did this and finished the week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>(Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her maid.)  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So Jacob had sexual relations with Rachel also. And Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah. Jacob worked for Laban for another seven years. </div><div class='s'>Jacob’s Family Grows </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The LORD saw that Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah, so he made it possible for Leah to have children. But Rachel did not have any children. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Leah gave birth to a son, and she named him Reuben.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Reuben This is like the Hebrew word meaning “Look, a son.”</span></a> She named him this because she said, “The LORD has seen my troubles. My husband does not love me. So now maybe my husband will love me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Leah became pregnant again and had another son. She named this son Simeon.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Simeon This is like the Hebrew word meaning “He hears.”</span></a> She said, “The LORD has heard that I am not loved, so he gave me this son.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Leah became pregnant again and had another son. She named this son Levi.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Levi This is like the Hebrew word meaning “accompany,” “be joined together,” or “become close.”</span></a> She said, “Now, surely my husband will love me. I have given him three sons.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Leah gave birth to another son. She named this son Judah.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Judah This name is like the word meaning “He is praised.”</span></a> Leah named him this because she said, “Now I will praise the LORD.” Then Leah stopped having children. </div><ul class='tnav'>
