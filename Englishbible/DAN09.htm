<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='s'>Daniel’s Prayer </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>These things happened during the first year that Darius son of Ahasuerus<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Ahasuerus Or “Xerxes.”</span></a> was king. Darius was a Mede by birth, but he was appointed to be the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>During his first year as king, I was studying the Scriptures<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Scriptures Literally, “scrolls.”</span></a> and noticed in the LORD’S message to Jeremiah that 70 years would pass before Jerusalem would be rebuilt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then I turned to the Lord God. I prayed to him and asked him for help. I did not eat any food. I put ashes on my head and put on the clothes that showed I was sad.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I prayed to the LORD my God and told him about all my sins. I said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='pi'>“Lord, you are a great and awesome God. You keep your agreement of love and kindness with people who love you. You keep your agreement with the people who obey your commands. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“But we have sinned. We have done wrong. We have done evil things. We turned against you. We turned away from your commands and good decisions.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The prophets were your servants. They spoke for you to our kings, to our leaders, to our fathers, and to the common people in our country. But we did not listen to them. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“Lord, you are innocent, and the shame belongs to us, even now. Shame belongs to the people from Judah and Jerusalem, and to all the people of Israel, to those who are near and to those you scattered among many nations. They should be ashamed of all the evil things they did against you. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“LORD, we should all be ashamed. All our kings and leaders should be ashamed. Our ancestors should be ashamed, because we sinned against you. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“But, Lord our God, you are kind and forgiving, even though we rebelled against you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>We have not obeyed the LORD our God. He used his servants, the prophets, and gave us laws, but we have not obeyed his laws.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All the people of Israel disobeyed your teachings and turned away from you. They did not listen to you. We sinned, so you did what you promised to do. All the curses and promises<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> curses and promises Part of the agreement that God made with the people of Israel. See, for example, Deuteronomy 27-30.</span></a> in the Law of Moses, your servant, happened to us. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“God said those things would happen to us and our leaders, and he made them happen. He made terrible things happen to us. No other city suffered the way Jerusalem suffered.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>All those terrible things happened to us. This happened just as it is written in the Law of Moses, but we still have not asked the LORD our God for help. We still have not stopped sinning. We still do not pay attention to your truth, Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The LORD kept the terrible things ready for us—he made them happen to us. The LORD our God did this because he is fair in everything he does. But we still have not listened to him. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“Lord our God, you used your power and brought us out of Egypt. We are your people. You are famous because of that, even today. We have sinned and done terrible things.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Lord, we and our ancestors sinned against you, so your people and your city became a disgrace to everyone around us. You do so many good things, so stop being angry at Jerusalem, your city, your holy mountain. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Now, our God, hear your servant’s prayer. Listen to my prayer for mercy. For your own sake, do good things for your holy place.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> do … holy place Literally, “let your face shine on your holy place.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>My God, listen to me! Open your eyes and see all the terrible things that have happened to us. See what has happened to the city that is called by your name. I am not saying we are good people. That is not why I am asking these things. I am asking these things because I know you are kind.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Lord, listen to me! Forgive us! Lord, pay attention, and then do something! Don’t wait! Do something now! Do it for your own good! My God, do something now, for your city and your people who are called by your name.” </div><div class='s'>The Vision About the 70 Weeks </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I was praying to the LORD my God about his holy mountain and telling about my sins and the sins of the people of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>That was the time of the evening sacrifices. While I was still praying, Gabriel, the one I saw in the first vision, flew quickly to me and touched me. He came at the time of the evening sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Gabriel helped me understand the things I wanted to know. He said, “Daniel, I have come to give you wisdom and to help you understand.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When you first started praying, the command was given to come speak to you. God loves you very much! You will understand this command, and you will understand the vision. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>“God has allowed 70 weeks<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> week Or “unit of seven.” The Hebrew word could mean “week” or “a period of seven years.” Also in verses 25, 27.</span></a> for your people and your holy city, Daniel. The 70 weeks are ordered for these reasons: to stop doing bad things, to stop sinning, to make people pure, to bring the goodness that continues forever, to put a seal on visions and prophets, and to dedicate a very holy place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“Learn and understand these things, Daniel. From the time that the message went out to go back and rebuild Jerusalem until the time for the chosen king<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> chosen king Literally, “anointed one.”</span></a> to come will be seven weeks. Then Jerusalem will be rebuilt. There will again be places for people to meet together in Jerusalem, and there will be a ditch around the city to protect it. Jerusalem will be built for 62 weeks, but there will be many troubles during that time.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>After the 62 weeks, the chosen one will be killed.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> killed Literally, “cut off.”</span></a> He will be gone.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> He will be gone Or “He will have nothing.”</span></a> Then the people of the future leader will destroy the city and the holy place. That end will come like a flood. War will continue until the end. God has ordered that place to be completely destroyed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>“Then the future ruler will make an agreement with many people. That agreement will continue for one week. The offerings and sacrifices will stop for a half of a week. And a destroyer will come. He will do terrible, destructive things,<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> He will do … things Or “He will come on the wings of terrible destruction.”</span></a> but God has ordered that destroyer to be completely destroyed.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
