Whenever someone brings a sacrifice, priests are supposed to put the meat in a pot of boiling water. Then their servant is supposed to get the three-pronged fork  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and use it to get some meat out of the pot or kettle. The priest is supposed to take whatever his helper removes from the pot with the special fork. This is what the priests should have done for the Israelites who came to offer sacrifices at Shiloh.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But that is not what the sons of Eli did. Even before the fat was burned on the altar, their servant would go to the people offering sacrifices and say, “Give the priest some meat to roast. The priest won’t accept boiled meat from you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Maybe the man offering the sacrifice would say, “Burn the fat<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Burn the fat The fat was the part of the animal that belonged only to God. It was supposed to be burned first as an offering to him.</span></a> first, and then you can take whatever you want.” But the servant would answer: “No, give me the meat now. If you don’t give it to me, I’ll take it from you!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In this way Hophni and Phinehas showed that they did not respect the offerings made to the LORD. This was a terrible sin against the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Samuel served the LORD. He was a helper who wore the linen ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Every year Samuel’s mother made a robe for Samuel. She took the little robe to Samuel when she went up to Shiloh with her husband for the sacrifice every year. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife. He would say, “May the LORD give you more children through Hannah who will take the place of the boy she prayed for and gave to the LORD.” </div><div class='p'>Elkanah and Hannah went home.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The LORD was kind to Hannah, and she had three sons and two daughters. The boy Samuel grew up at the holy place near the LORD. </div><div class='s'>Eli Fails to Control His Evil Sons </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Eli was very old. He heard about the bad things his sons were doing to the Israelites at Shiloh and how his sons were having sexual relations with the women who served at the door of the Meeting Tent. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Eli said to his sons, “The people here told me about the evil things you have done. Why are you doing such things?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Sons, stop that! The LORD’S people are saying bad things about you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If you sin against other people, God might protect you. But who can help you if you sin against the LORD?” </div><div class='p'>Eli’s sons refused to listen to him, so the LORD decided to kill them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The boy Samuel kept growing. He was pleasing to the LORD and to the people. </div><div class='s'>The Terrible Prophecy <br/> About Eli’s Family </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A man of God came to Eli and said, “The LORD says, ‘I appeared to your ancestors<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> ancestors Literally, “father’s house.” See “ancestor” in the Word List.</span></a> when they were slaves of Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>From all the tribes of Israel, I chose your tribe to be my priests. I chose them to offer sacrifices on my altar, to burn incense, and wear the ephod. I also let your tribe have the meat from the sacrifices that the Israelites give to me.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So why don’t you respect these gifts and sacrifices? You honor your sons more than me. You become fat eating the best parts of the meat that the Israelites bring to me.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>“The LORD, the God of Israel, promised that your father’s family would serve him forever. But now the LORD says, ‘That will never be! I will honor people who honor me, but bad things will happen to those who refuse to respect me.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The time is coming when I will destroy all your descendants. No one in your family will live to be an old man.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Good things will happen to Israel, but you will see bad things happening at home.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> but you … at home These words are not in the ancient Greek version or the Hebrew scrolls from Qumran.</span></a> No one in your family will live to be an old man.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>There is only one man I will save to serve as priest at my altar. He will live until his eyes wear out and his strength is gone. But all of your descendants will die by the sword.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> by the sword This is found in the ancient Greek version and a Hebrew scroll from Qumran.

Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will die on the same day.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>I will choose a priest I can trust. This priest will listen to me and do what I want. I will make his family strong, and he will always serve before my chosen king.<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> chosen king Literally, “anointed one.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then whoever is left in your family will come and bow down before this priest and beg for a little money or a piece of bread. They will say, “Please give me a job as priest so that I can have some food to eat.” ’ ” </div><ul class='tnav'>
