</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='s'>Job, the Good Man </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>There was a man named Job who lived in the country of Uz. He was a good, honest man. He respected God and refused to do evil.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Job had seven sons and three daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He owned 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, 1000 oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He had many servants. He was the richest man in the east. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Job’s sons took turns having dinner parties in their homes, and they invited their sisters.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The day after each of these parties, Job got up early in the morning, sent for his children, and offered a burnt offering for each of them. He thought, “Maybe my children were careless and sinned against God at their party.” Job always did this so that his children would be forgiven of their sins. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then the day came for the angels<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> angels Literally, “sons of God.”</span></a> to meet with the LORD. Even Satan was there with them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you been?” </div><div class='p'>Satan answered the LORD, “I have been roaming around the earth, going from place to place.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him. He is a good, faithful man. He respects God and refuses to do evil.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Satan answered the LORD, “But Job has a good reason to respect you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You always protect him, his family, and everything he has. You have blessed him and made him successful in everything he does. He is so wealthy that his herds and flocks are all over the country.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But if you were to destroy everything he has, I promise you that he would curse you to your face.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The LORD said to Satan, “All right, do whatever you want with anything that he has, but don’t hurt Job himself.” </div><div class='p'>Then Satan left the meeting. </div><div class='s'>Job Loses Everything </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>One day Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>A messenger came to Job and said, “We were plowing the fields with the oxen and the donkeys were eating grass nearby,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>when some Sabeans<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Sabeans A group of people from the Arabian Desert, probably south of Uz.</span></a> attacked us and took your animals! They killed the other servants. I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>That messenger was still speaking when another one came in and said, “A bolt of lightning<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> A bolt of lightning Or “God’s fire fell from the sky.”</span></a> struck your sheep and servants and burned them up. I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>That messenger was still speaking when another one came in and said, “The Chaldeans<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Chaldeans Tribes of people who moved from place to place in the area between the Euphrates and Jordan rivers.</span></a> sent out three raiding parties that attacked us and took the camels! They killed the other servants. I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>That messenger was still speaking when another one came in and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A strong wind suddenly came in from across the desert and blew the house down. It fell on your sons and daughters, and they are all dead. I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When Job heard this, he got up, tore his clothes, and shaved his head to show his sadness. Then he fell to the ground to bow down before God  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“When I was born into this world, </div><div class='q2'>I was naked and had nothing. </div><div class='q'>When I die and leave this world, </div><div class='q2'>I will be naked and have nothing. </div><div class='q'>The LORD gives, </div><div class='q2'>and the LORD takes away. </div><div class='q'>Praise the name of the LORD!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Even after all this, Job did not sin.
