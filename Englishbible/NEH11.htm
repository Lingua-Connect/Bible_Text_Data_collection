The rest of the people used lots to decide who else should move there with the leaders. They chose a tenth of the people to live in Jerusalem, the holy city. The rest of the people stayed in their own towns.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The people who stayed asked God to bless those who were willing to move to Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Some of the Israelites, priests, Levites, servants, and descendants of Solomon’s servants lived in the various towns throughout Judah. These all lived on property they owned in these towns.
