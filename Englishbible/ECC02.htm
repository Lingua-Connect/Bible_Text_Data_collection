<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='s'>Does “Having Fun” Bring Happiness? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I said to myself, “I should have fun—I should enjoy everything as much as I can.” But I learned that this is also useless.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>It is foolish to laugh all the time. Having fun does not do any good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So I decided to fill my body with wine while I filled my mind with wisdom. I tried this foolishness because I wanted to find a way to be happy. I wanted to see what was good for people to do during their few days of life. </div><div class='s'>Does Hard Work Bring Happiness? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then I began doing great things. I built houses, and I planted vineyards for myself.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I planted gardens, and I made parks. I planted all kinds of fruit trees.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I made pools of water for myself, and I used them to water my growing trees.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I bought men and women slaves, and there were slaves born in my house. I owned many great things. I had herds of cattle and flocks of sheep. I owned more things than any other person in Jerusalem did. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I also gathered silver and gold for myself. I took treasures from kings and their nations. I had men and women singing for me. I had everything any man could want. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I became very rich and famous. I was greater than anyone who lived in Jerusalem before me. My wisdom was always there to help me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Anything my eyes saw and wanted, I got for myself. My mind was pleased with everything I did. And this happiness was the reward for all my hard work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But then I looked at everything I had done and the wealth I had gained. I decided it was all a waste of time! It was like trying to catch the wind.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> trying to catch the wind Or “It is very troubling to the spirit.” The word for “troubling” can also mean “craving,” and the word for “spirit” can also mean “wind.” Also in verses 17, 26.</span></a> There is nothing to gain from anything we do in this life.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> in this life Literally, “under the sun.” Also in verses 17, 22.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Maybe Wisdom Is the Answer </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then I decided to think about what it means to be wise or to be foolish or to do crazy things. And I thought about the one who will be the next king. The new king will do the same as the kings before him.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> And I thought … before him The Hebrew text here is hard to understand.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I saw that wisdom is better than foolishness in the same way that light is better than darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Wise people use their minds like eyes to see where they are going. But for fools, it is as if they are walking in the dark. </div><div class='p'>I also saw that fools and wise people both end the same way.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I thought to myself, “The same thing that happens to a fool will also happen to me. So why have I tried so hard to become wise?” I said to myself, “Being wise is also useless.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Whether people are wise or foolish, they will still die, and no one will remember either one of them forever. In the future, people will forget everything both of them did. So the two are really the same. </div><div class='s'>Is There Real Happiness in Life? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This made me hate life. It was depressing to think that everything in this life is useless, like trying to catch the wind. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I began to hate all the hard work I had done, because I saw that the people who live after me would get the things that I worked for. I will not be able to take them with me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Some other person will control everything I worked and studied for. And I don’t know if that person will be wise or foolish. This is also senseless. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So I became sad about all the work I had done.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>People can work hard using all their wisdom and knowledge and skill. But they will die and other people will get the things they worked for. They did not do the work, but they will get everything. That makes me very sad. It is also not fair and is senseless. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>What do people really have after all their work and struggling in this life?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Throughout their life, they have pain, frustrations, and hard work. Even at night, a person’s mind does not rest. This is also senseless. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24-25&#160;</span>There is no one who has tried to enjoy life more than I have. And this is what I learned: The best thing people can do is eat, drink, and enjoy the work they must do. I also saw that this comes from God.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Or “24 The best people can do is eat, drink, and enjoy their work. I also saw that this comes from God. 25 No one can eat or enjoy life without God.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If people do good and please God, he will give them wisdom, knowledge, and joy. But those who sin will get only the work of gathering and carrying things. God takes from the bad person and gives to the good person. But all this work is useless. It is like trying to catch the wind. </div><ul class='tnav'>
