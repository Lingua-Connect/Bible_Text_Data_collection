These animals chew the cud, but they don’t have split hooves. So these animals are not a clean food for you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And you must not eat pigs. Their hooves are divided, but they don’t chew the cud. So pigs are not a clean food for you. Don’t eat any meat from pigs. Don’t even touch a pig’s dead body. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“You may eat any kind of fish that has fins and scales.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But don’t eat anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales.

You will go there to be with the LORD your God. At that place you will eat the tenth of your crops—one-tenth of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the first animals born in your herds and flocks. In this way you will always remember to respect the LORD your God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But that place might be too far for you to travel to. Maybe you will not be able to carry one-tenth of all the crops that the LORD has blessed you with. If that happens,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>sell that part of your crops and take the money with you to the special place the LORD has chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Use the money to buy anything you want—cattle, sheep, wine or beer or any other food. Then you and your family should eat and enjoy yourselves there in that place with the LORD your God.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But don’t forget the Levites living in your town.

Also keep this food for the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. This will provide enough for them to come and eat all they want. If you do this, the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do. </div><ul class='tnav'>
