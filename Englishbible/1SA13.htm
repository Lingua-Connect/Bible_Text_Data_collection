They felt trapped. They ran away to hide in caves and cracks in the rock. They hid among the rocks, in wells, and in other holes in the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Some Hebrews even went across the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal. All the men in his army were shaking with fear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Samuel said he would meet Saul at Gilgal. Saul waited there seven days. But Samuel had not yet come to Gilgal, and the soldiers began to leave Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings.” Then Saul offered the burnt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As soon as Saul finished offering that sacrifice, Samuel arrived.

So I forced myself to offer the burnt offering.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Samuel said, “You did a foolish thing. You did not obey the LORD your God. If you had done what he commanded, the LORD would have let your family rule Israel forever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But now your kingdom won’t continue.

Saul counted the men who were still with him.

The Philistine army split into three groups.

The Philistines would not allow them because they were afraid the Israelites would make iron swords and spears.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Only the Philistines could sharpen iron tools. So if the Israelites needed to sharpen their plows, hoes, axes, or sickles, they had to go to the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Philistine blacksmiths charged 1/3 ounce<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> 1/3 ounce Literally, “1 <span class='tl'>pim</span>” (7.8 g).</span></a> of silver for sharpening plows and hoes and 1/6 ounce<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 1/6 ounce Literally, “1/3 shekel” (3.8 g).</span></a> of silver for sharpening picks, axes, and the iron tip on ox goads.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So on the day of battle, none of the Israelite soldiers with Saul had iron swords or spears.
