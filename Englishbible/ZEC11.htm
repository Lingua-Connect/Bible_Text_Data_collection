Those who sell the sheep say, ‘Praise the LORD, I am rich!’ The shepherds don’t feel sorry for their sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I don’t feel sorry for the people who live in this country.” This is what the LORD said: “Look, I will let everyone be under the control of their neighbor and king. I will let them destroy the country—I will not stop them!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So I took care of the sheep that had been raised to be killed—those poor sheep. I found two sticks. I called one stick Favor, and I called the other stick Union. Then I began caring for the sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I fired the three shepherds all in one month. I got angry at the sheep, and they began to hate me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then I said, “I quit! I will not take care of you! I will let those who want to die, die. I will let those who want to be destroyed, be destroyed, and those who are left will destroy each other.”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then I took the stick named Favor, and I broke it. I did this to show that God’s agreement with his people was broken.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So that day the agreement was finished, and those poor sheep watching me knew that this message was from the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then I said, “If you want to pay me, pay me. If not, don’t!” So they paid me 30 pieces of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then the LORD told me, “So that’s how much they think I’m worth. Throw that large amount of money<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> large amount of money The Lord was making fun of the people.

I did this to show that the union between Judah and Israel had been broken. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to me, “Now, get the things a foolish shepherd might use.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>This will show that I will get a new shepherd for this country. But this young man will not be able to take care of the sheep that are being destroyed. He will not be able to heal the hurt sheep or feed those that are left alive. And the healthy ones will be eaten completely—only their hoofs will be left.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Too bad for you, you worthless shepherd! </div><div class='q2'>You abandoned my sheep. </div><div class='q'>Punish him! </div><div class='q2'>Strike his arm and right eye with a sword. </div><div class='q2'>His arm will be useless. </div><div class='q2'>His right eye will be blind. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
