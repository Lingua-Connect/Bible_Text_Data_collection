Nadab was the firstborn son. Then there were Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>These sons were the chosen<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> chosen Or “anointed.” See “anoint” in the Word List.</span></a> priests. They were given the special work of serving the LORD as priests.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But Nadab and Abihu died while serving the LORD. They used fire that the LORD did not allow when they made an offering to him. So Nadab and Abihu died there, in the desert of Sinai. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar took their place and served the Lord as priests. This happened while their father Aaron was still alive. </div><div class='s'>Levites—the Priests’ Helpers </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“Bring all the men from the tribe of Levi. Bring them to Aaron the priest. These men will be his helpers.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Levites will help him when he serves at the Meeting Tent. And they will help all the Israelites when they come to worship at the Holy Tent.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Israelites should protect everything in the Meeting Tent; it is their duty. But the Levites will serve the Israelites by caring for these things. This will be their way of serving at the Holy Tent. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. The Levites were chosen from all the Israelites to help Aaron and his sons. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“Appoint Aaron and his sons to be priests.

At that time I chose all the firstborn from every family in Israel to be mine in a special way. That included all the firstborn men and animals. But now I am choosing the Levites to take their place. Now they will be my special servants. I, the LORD, give this command!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The LORD again said to Moses in the desert of Sinai,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“Count all the families and family groups in the tribe of Levi. Count every man or boy who is one month old or older.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Moses obeyed the LORD.

They also took care of the curtain at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They cared for the curtain in the courtyard. And they cared for the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard. This courtyard was around the Holy Tent and the altar.

The Kohathites were given the job of taking care of the things in the Holy Place.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The Kohathite family groups were given the area to the south of the Holy Tent. This was the area where they camped.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The leader of the Kohathite family groups was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Their job was to take care of the Holy Box, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the dishes of the Holy Place.

There were 6200 men and boys who were one month old or older in the Mahli family group.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The leader of the Merari family group was Zuriel son of Abihail. This family group was given the area to the north of the Holy Tent. This is the area where they camped.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The people from the Merari family were given the job of caring for the frames of the Holy Tent. They cared for all the braces, posts, bases, and everything that was used with the frames of the Holy Tent.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They also cared for all the posts in the courtyard around the Holy Tent. This included all the bases, tent pegs, and ropes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Moses, Aaron, and his sons camped east of the Holy Tent, in front of the Meeting Tent. They were given the work of caring for the Holy Place. They did this for all the Israelites. Anyone else who came near the Holy Place was to be killed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The LORD commanded Moses and Aaron to count all the men and boys one month old or older in Levi’s family group. The total number was 22,000. </div><div class='s'>Levites Take the Place of the Firstborn </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses, “Count all the firstborn men and boys in Israel who are at least one month old.

I will also take the animals from the Levites instead of taking all the firstborn animals from the other people in Israel.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>So Moses did what the LORD commanded. He counted all the firstborn children of the Israelites.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>He listed all the firstborn men and boys who were one month old or older. There were 22,273 names on that list. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>The LORD also said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>“I, the LORD, give this command: ‘Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn men from the other families of Israel. And I will take the animals of the Levites instead of the animals of the other people. The Levites are mine.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>There are 22,000 Levites, but there are 22,273 firstborn sons from the other families.

He collected 1365 shekels<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 1365 shekels 35 pounds (15.7 kg).</span></a> of silver, using the official measure.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Moses obeyed the LORD’S command and gave the silver to Aaron and his sons.
