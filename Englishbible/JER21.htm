<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='s'>God Rejects King Zedekiah’s Request </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD. This was when King Zedekiah of Judah sent Pashhur<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Pashhur This is not the same Pashhur as the man in Jeremiah 20:1.</span></a> son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah. They brought a message for Jeremiah.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They said to Jeremiah, “Pray to the LORD for us. Ask him what will happen. We want to know, because King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon is attacking us. Maybe the LORD will do great things for us, as he did in the past. Maybe he will make Nebuchadnezzar stop attacking us and leave.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Jeremiah answered Pashhur and Zephaniah. He said, “Tell King Zedekiah,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: You have weapons of war in your hands that you are using to defend yourselves from the Babylonians and their king. But I will make those weapons worthless. </div><div class='p'>“ ‘The army from Babylon is outside the wall all around the city. Soon I will bring that army into Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I myself will fight against you people of Judah. I will fight against you with my own powerful hand. I am very angry with you, so I will fight against you with my own powerful arm. I will fight very hard against you and show how angry I am.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will kill everything living in Jerusalem, both people and animals. They will die from a terrible disease that will spread all through the city.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>After that happens,’ ” says the LORD, “ ‘I will give King Zedekiah of Judah and all his officials to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. And I will give to Nebuchadnezzar the people who remain alive in Jerusalem—those who did not die from the terrible disease and the people who did not die in war or from hunger. I will give them all to King Nebuchadnezzar. The people of Judah will be captured by their enemies who want to kill them. Nebuchadnezzar’s army will use their swords to kill the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar will not show any mercy. He will not feel sorry for them.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“Also tell the people of Jerusalem, ‘This is what the LORD says: Understand that I will let you choose to live or die.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Anyone who stays in Jerusalem will die in war or from hunger or disease. But anyone who goes out of Jerusalem and surrenders to the Babylonians attacking you will live. Only those who leave the city will win anything in this war—their lives!  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I have decided to make trouble for the city of Jerusalem. I will not help this city! I will give it to the king of Babylon, who will burn it with fire.’ ” This message is from the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“Say this to Judah’s royal family: ‘Listen to the message from the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Family of David, this is what the LORD says: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“ ‘You must judge people fairly every day. </div><div class='q2'>Protect the victims from the criminals. </div><div class='q'>If you don’t do that, I will become very angry. </div><div class='q2'>My anger will be like a fire that no one will be able to put out. </div><div class='q2'>This will happen because you have done evil things.’ </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Jerusalem, I am against you. </div><div class='q2'>You sit on top of the mountain. </div><div class='q2'>You sit like a queen over this valley. </div><div class='q'>You people of Jerusalem say, </div><div class='q2'>‘No one can attack us. </div><div class='q2'>No one can come into our strong city.’ ” </div><div class='q'>This message is from the LORD. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“You will get the punishment you deserve. </div><div class='q2'>I will start a fire in your forests </div><div class='q2'>that will completely burn everything around you.” </div><div class='q'>This message is from the LORD. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
