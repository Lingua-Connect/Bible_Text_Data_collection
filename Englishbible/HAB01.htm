When will you listen to me? I cried to you about the violence, but you did nothing!  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>People are stealing things and hurting others. They are arguing and fighting. Why do you make me look at these terrible things?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The law is weak and not fair to people. Evil people win their fights against good people. So the law is no longer fair, and justice does not win anymore. </div><div class='s'>The Lord Answers Habakkuk </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Look at the other nations!

They will take houses and cities that don’t belong to them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Babylonians will scare the other people. They will do what they want to do and go where they want to go.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Their horses will be faster than leopards and more dangerous than wolves at sunset. Their horse soldiers will come from faraway places. They will attack their enemies quickly, like a hungry eagle swooping down from the sky.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The one thing they all want to do is fight. Their armies will march fast like the wind in the desert. And the Babylonian soldiers will take many prisoners—as many as the grains of sand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“The Babylonian soldiers will laugh at the kings of other nations.
