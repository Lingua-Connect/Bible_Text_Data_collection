That fountain will be to wash away their sins and to make the people pure. </div><div class='s'>No More False Prophets </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful says, “At that time I will remove all the idols from the earth. People will not even remember their names, and I will remove the false prophets and unclean spirits from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Whoever continues to prophesy will be punished. Even their parents, their own mother and father, will say to them, ‘You have spoken lies in the name of the LORD, so you must die!’ Their own mother and father will stab them for prophesying.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>At that time the prophets will be ashamed of their visions and prophecies. They will not wear the rough cloth that shows a person is a prophet. They will not wear those clothes to trick people with the lies they call prophecies.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They will say, ‘I am not a prophet. I am a farmer. I have worked as a farmer since I was a little child.’  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But other people will say, ‘Then what are these wounds in your hands?’ He will say, ‘I was beaten in the house of my friends.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful says, “Sword, wake up and strike the shepherd, my friend! Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will run away. And I will punish those little ones.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Two-thirds of the people in the land will be struck down and die,” says the LORD, “but one-third will survive.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then I will test those survivors by giving them many troubles. The troubles will be like the fire a person uses to prove silver is pure. I will test them the way a person tests gold. Then they will call to me for help, and I will answer them. I will say, ‘You are my people.’ And they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’ ” </div><ul class='tnav'>
