This name means “hearth” or “fireplace” but sounds like the word meaning “Lion of God.” Also in verse 7.</span></a> the city where David camped. Keep on having your festivals, year after year.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But I will punish Ariel. The city will be filled with sadness and crying, but it will always be my Ariel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“I will put armies all around you, Ariel. I will raise war towers against you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You will be pulled to the ground. Your voice will rise from the ground like the voice of a ghost. Your words come like a whisper from the dirt.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There will be so many foreigners that they will be like dust. Cruel people will be like the chaff blowing in the wind. Then suddenly,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>the LORD All-Powerful will punish you with earthquakes, thunder, and loud noises. There will be storms, strong winds, and a burning, destructive fire.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Many nations will fight against Ariel. It will be a nightmare. Armies will surround Ariel and punish her.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But it will also be like a dream to those armies. They will not get what they want. It will be like a hungry man dreaming about food. When the man wakes up, he is still hungry. It will be like a thirsty man dreaming about water. When the man wakes up, he is still thirsty. The same thing is true about all the nations fighting against Zion. Those nations will not get what they want. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Be surprised and amazed! </div><div class='q2'>You will become drunk, but not from wine. </div><div class='q'>Look and be amazed! </div><div class='q2'>You will stumble and fall, but not from beer. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The LORD will make you sleepy. </div><div class='q2'>He will close your eyes. (The prophets are your eyes.) </div><div class='q2'>He will cover your heads. (The prophets are your heads.) </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>To you my words are like the words in a book that is closed and sealed.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> sealed A piece of clay or wax was put on the closed book to show that the book should not be opened.</span></a> You can give the book to someone who can read and tell that person to read it. But that person will say, “I cannot read the book. It is closed and I cannot open it.”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Or you can give the book to someone who cannot read and tell that person to read it. That person will say, “I cannot read the book because I don’t know how to read.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Lord says, “These people come to honor me with words, but I am not really important to them. The worship they give me is nothing but human rules they have memorized.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So I will continue to amaze them by doing powerful and amazing things. Their wise men will lose their wisdom. Even the most intelligent among them will not be able to understand.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Look at them! They try to hide things from the LORD. They think he will not understand. They do their evil things in darkness. They tell themselves: “No one can see us. No one will know who we are.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>You turn things upside down. You think the clay is equal to the potter. You think that something that is made can tell the one who made it, “You did not make me!” This is like a pot telling its maker, “You know nothing.” </div><div class='s'>A Better Time Is Coming </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This is the truth: After a very short time, Lebanon will become rich farmland, and the farmland will be like thick forests.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The deaf will hear the words in the book. The blind will see through the darkness and fog.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The LORD will make poor people happy. The poorest people will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This will happen when the people who are mean and cruel have come to an end. It will happen when those who enjoy doing bad things are gone.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>(They lie about good people. They try to trap people in court. They try to destroy innocent people.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the LORD, who made Abraham free, speaks to Jacob’s family. He says, “Now the people of Jacob will not be embarrassed and ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They will look around at all the children they have I made with my hands, and they will say that my name is holy. They will honor<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> honor Or “treat as holy.”</span></a> the Holy One of Jacob. They will respect the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Many of these people did not understand, so they did what was wrong. They complained, but now they will learn their lesson.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
