<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 41</div><div class='s'>Pharaoh’s Dreams </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Two years later Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile River.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In the dream, seven cows came out of the river and stood there eating grass. They were healthy, good-looking cows.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then seven more cows came out of the river and stood on the bank of the river by the healthy cows. But these cows were thin and looked sick.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The seven sick cows ate the seven healthy cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Pharaoh went back to sleep and began dreaming again. This time he dreamed that he saw seven heads of grain growing on one plant. They were healthy and full of grain.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then he saw seven more heads of grain sprouting, but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain. Then Pharaoh woke up again and realized it was only a dream.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The next morning Pharaoh was worried about these dreams, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told these men the dreams, but none of them could explain the dreams. </div><div class='s'>The Servant Tells Pharaoh <br/> About Joseph </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the wine servant remembered Joseph and said to Pharaoh, “I remember something that happened to me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You were angry with the baker and me, and you put us in prison.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then one night he and I had a dream. Each dream had a different meaning.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There was a young Hebrew man in prison with us. He was a servant of the commander of the guards. We told him our dreams, and he explained them to us. He told us the meaning of each dream,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and what he said came true. He said I would be free and have my old job back, and it happened. He also said the baker would die, and it happened!” </div><div class='s'>Joseph Is Called to Explain the Dreams </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Pharaoh called Joseph from the prison. The guards quickly got Joseph out of prison. Joseph shaved, put on some clean clothes, and went to see Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can explain it for me. I heard that you can explain dreams when someone tells you about them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Joseph answered, “I cannot! But God can explain the dream for you, Pharaoh.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing by the Nile River.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Seven cows came up out of the river and stood there eating the grass. They were healthy, good-looking cows.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then I saw seven more cows come up out of the river after them, but these cows were thin and looked sick. They were the worst cows I had ever seen anywhere in Egypt!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The thin, sick cows ate the first healthy cows,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>but they still looked thin and sick. You couldn’t even tell they had eaten the healthy cows. They looked as thin and sick as they did in the beginning. Then I woke up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“In my next dream I saw seven heads of grain growing on one plant. They were healthy and full of grain.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And then seven more heads of grain grew after them, but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain. </div><div class='p'>“I told these dreams to my magicians. But no one could explain the dreams to me. What do they mean?” </div><div class='s'>Joseph Explains the Dream </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Both of these dreams have the same meaning. God is telling you what will happen soon.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The seven good cows and the seven good heads of grain are seven good years.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the seven thin, sick-looking cows and the seven thin heads of grain mean that there will be seven years of hunger in this area. These seven bad years will come after the seven good years.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>God has shown you what will happen soon. He will make these things happen just as I told you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For seven years there will be plenty of food in Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But then there will be seven years of hunger. The people will forget how much food there had been in Egypt before. This famine will ruin the country.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>It will be so bad that people will forget what it was like to have plenty of food. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>“Pharaoh, you had two dreams about the same thing. That means God wanted to show you that he really will make this happen, and he will make it happen soon!  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So, Pharaoh, you should choose a wise, intelligent man and put him in charge of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then you should choose other men to collect food from the people. During the seven good years, the people must give them one-fifth of all the food they grow.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>In this way these men will collect all the food during the seven good years and store it in the cities until it is needed. Pharaoh, this food will be under your control.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then during the seven years of hunger, there will be food for the country of Egypt. And Egypt will not be destroyed by the famine.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>This seemed like a very good idea to Pharaoh, and all his officials agreed.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh told them, “I don’t think we can find anyone better than Joseph to take this job! God’s Spirit is in him, making him very wise!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “God showed these things to you, so you must be the wisest man.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>I will put you in charge of my country, and the people will obey all your commands. I will be the only one more powerful than you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I now make you governor over all of Egypt.”  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh gave his special ring to Joseph. The royal seal was on this ring. Pharaoh also gave Joseph a fine linen robe and put a gold chain around his neck.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then he told Joseph to ride in his second chariot. Pharaoh’s officials said, “Let him be the governor over the whole land of Egypt!”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or “Then Pharaoh had Joseph ride in the chariot of his second-in-command, and they said, ‘Bow before Joseph.’ In this way Joseph became the governor over all of Egypt.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh said to him, “I am Pharaoh, the king over everyone in Egypt, but no one else in Egypt can lift a hand or move a foot unless you say he can.”  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh gave Joseph another name, Zaphenath Paneah.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Zaphenath Paneah This Egyptian name probably means “sustainer of life,” but it is like Hebrew words meaning “a person who explains secret things.”</span></a> He also gave Joseph a wife named Asenath. She was the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in the city of On. So Joseph became the governor over the whole country of Egypt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Joseph was 30 years old when he began serving the king of Egypt. He traveled throughout the country of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>During the seven good years, the crops in Egypt grew very well.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Joseph saved the food in Egypt during those seven years and stored the food in the cities. In every city he stored grain that grew in the fields around the city.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Joseph stored so much grain that it was like the sands of the sea. He stored so much grain that it could not be measured. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Joseph’s wife, Asenath, was the daughter of Potiphera, the priest in the city of On. Before the first year of hunger came, Joseph and Asenath had two sons.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Joseph named the first son Manasseh.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Manasseh This is like the Hebrew word meaning “to forget.”</span></a> He was given this name because Joseph said, “God made me forget all my hard work and everything back home in my father’s house.”  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Joseph named the second son Ephraim.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Ephraim This name is like the Hebrew word meaning “twice fruitful.”</span></a> Joseph gave him this name because he said, “I had great troubles, but God has made me successful in everything.” </div><div class='s'>The Famine Begins </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>For seven years people had all the food they needed, but those years ended.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Then the seven years of hunger began, just as Joseph had said. No food grew anywhere in any of the countries in that area. But in Egypt people had plenty to eat because Joseph had stored the grain.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>The famine began, and the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Pharaoh said to the Egyptian people, “Go ask Joseph what to do.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>There was famine everywhere, so Joseph gave the people grain from the warehouses. He sold the stored grain to the people of Egypt. The famine was bad in Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>but the famine was bad everywhere. So people from the countries around Egypt had to come to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain. </div><ul class='tnav'>
