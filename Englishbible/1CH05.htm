Reuben should have received the special privileges of the oldest son. But he had sexual relations with his father’s wife. So those privileges were given to Joseph’s sons. In the family history, Reuben’s name is not listed as the first son. Judah became stronger than his brothers, so the leaders came from his family. But Joseph’s family got the other privileges that belong to the oldest son. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'>Reuben’s sons were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>These are the names of Joel’s descendants: Shemaiah was Joel’s son.

They lived there because they had many cattle in the land of Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When Saul was king, Bela’s people fought a war against the Hagrites.

And they were also good with bows and arrows.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They started a war against the Hagrites and the people of Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The men from the tribes of Manasseh, Reuben, and Gad prayed to God during the war. They asked God to help them because they trusted him, so God helped them. He allowed them to defeat the Hagrites and those who were with the Hagrites.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They took the animals that belonged to the Hagrites. They took 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2000 donkeys, and 100,000 people.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Many Hagrites were killed because God helped the people of Reuben win the war.
