The LORD will be with you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But that night, the LORD’S word came to Nathan: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build a house for me to live in.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I did not live in a house at the time I took the Israelites out of Egypt. No, I traveled around in a tent. I used the tent for my home.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I never told any of the tribes of Israel to build me a fancy house made from cedar wood.’ </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“You must say this to my servant David: ‘This is what the LORD All-Powerful says: I chose you while you were out in the pasture following the sheep. I took you from that job and made you the leader of my people, the Israelites.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I have been with you every place you went. I have defeated your enemies for you. I will make you one of the most famous people on earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10-11&#160;</span>And I chose a place for my people, the Israelites. I planted the Israelites. I gave them their own place to live so that they will not have to move from place to place anymore. In the past, I sent judges to lead my people, but evil people gave them many troubles. That will not happen now. I am giving you peace from all of your enemies. I promise that I will make your family a family of kings.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> make … family of kings Literally, “make a house for you.”</span></a> </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“ ‘When your life is finished, you will die and be buried with your ancestors. But then I will make one of your own children become the king.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He will build a house for my name, and I will make his kingdom strong forever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will be his father, and he will be my son.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> father … son God “adopted” the kings from David’s family, and they became his “sons.” See Psalm 2:7.</span></a> When he sins, I will use other people to punish him. They will be my whips.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But I will never stop loving him. I will continue to be loyal to him. I took away my love and kindness from Saul. I pushed Saul away when I turned to you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Your family of kings will continue—you can depend on that! For you, your kingdom will continue forever! Your throne will stand forever!’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Nathan told David about that vision.

Why have you made me so important?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I am nothing but a servant, but Lord GOD, you have also said these kind things about my future family. Lord GOD, you don’t always talk like this to people, do you?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>How can I continue talking to you? Lord GOD, you know that I am only a servant.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>You will do all these wonderful things because you said you would do them and because you want to do them. And you decided to let me know about all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Lord GOD, this is why you are so great! There is no one like you. There is no god except you!

And you said that these good things would happen to me, your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Now, please, bless my family. Let them stand before you and serve you forever.
