He said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Son of man, tell the people of Jerusalem about the terrible things they have done.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You must say, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says to Jerusalem: Look at your history. You were born in Canaan. Your father was an Amorite. Your mother was a Hittite.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jerusalem, on the day you were born, there was no one to cut your navel cord. No one put salt on you and washed you to make you clean. No one wrapped you in cloth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>No one felt sorry for you or took care of you. On the day you were born, your parents threw you out into the field, because no one wanted you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“ ‘Then I passed by. I saw you lying there, kicking in the blood. You were covered with blood, but I said, “Please live!” Yes, you were covered with blood, but I said, “Please live!”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I helped you grow like a plant in the field. You grew and grew. You became a young woman: your periods began, your breasts grew, and your hair began to grow. But you were still bare and naked.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I looked you over. I saw you were ready for love, so I spread my clothes over you<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> spread my clothes over you This showed that he was agreeing to protect her and care for her.

I poured water over you to wash away the blood that was on you, and then I put oil on your skin.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Verses 10-13 All the materials in this list are the things used in building the Holy Tent. See Exodus 25-40.</span></a> I gave you a nice dress and soft leather sandals, a linen headband, and a silk scarf.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I also gave you some jewelry. I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I gave you a nose ring, earrings, and a beautiful crown to wear.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You were beautiful in your gold and silver jewelry, and your linen, silk, and embroidered material. You ate the best foods. You were very, very beautiful, and you became the queen!  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You became famous for your beauty, all because I made you so lovely!’ ” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='s'>Jerusalem, the Unfaithful Bride </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“But you began to trust in your beauty. You used the good name you had and became unfaithful to me. You acted like a prostitute with every man who passed by. You gave yourself to them all!  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>You took your beautiful clothes and used them to decorate your places for worship.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> places for worship Or “high places.” See “high place” in the Word List. Also in verses 31, 39.</span></a> And you acted like a prostitute there. You gave yourself to every man who came by!  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then you took your beautiful jewelry that I gave you, and you used the gold and silver to make statues of men, and you had sex with them too!  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then you took the beautiful cloth and made clothes for those statues. You took the perfume and incense I gave you and put it in front of those idols.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I gave you bread, honey, and oil, but you gave that food to your idols. You offered them as a sweet smell to please your false gods. You acted like a prostitute with those false gods!” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“You and I had children together, but you took our children.

You built those places for worshiping false gods on every street corner.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>You built your mounds at the head of every road. Then you degraded your beauty. You used it to catch every man who walked by. You raised your skirt so that they could see your legs, and you acted like a prostitute with those men.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then you went to Egypt, your neighbor that is always ready for sex. With more and more sexual sin, you made me angry.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So I punished you! I took away part of your land. I let your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, do what they wanted to you. Even they were shocked at the evil things you did.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then you went to have sex with Assyria. You could not get enough. You were never satisfied.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So you turned to Canaan, and then to Babylonia, and still you were not satisfied.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>You are so weak. You let all those men cause you to sin. You acted just like a prostitute who wants to be the one in control.” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>God said, “But you were not exactly like a prostitute. You built your mounds at the head of every road, and you built your places for worship at every street corner. You had sex with all those men, but you did not ask them to pay you the way a prostitute does.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>You are a woman guilty of adultery. You would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Most prostitutes force men to pay them for sex, but you gave money to your many lovers. You paid all the men around to come in to have sex with you.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>You are just the opposite of most prostitutes who force men to pay them, because you pay the men to have sex with you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Prostitute, listen to the message from the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: “You have spent your money<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> spent your money Literally, “poured out your copper.” This might also mean “you have done the things that stain you with sin.”</span></a> and let your lovers and filthy gods see your naked body and have sex with you. You have killed your children and poured out their blood. This was your gift to those false gods.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>So I am bringing all of your lovers together. I will bring all the men you loved and all the men you hated. I will bring them all together and let them see you naked.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> let them see you naked The Hebrew words are like the words meaning “to be carried away as a prisoner to a foreign country.”</span></a> They will see you completely naked.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then I will punish you. I will punish you as a murderer and a woman who committed the sin of adultery. You will be punished as if by an angry and jealous husband.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>I will let those lovers have you. They will destroy your mounds. They will burn your places for worship. They will tear off your clothes and take your beautiful jewelry. They will leave you bare and naked <span class='add'>as you were when I found you</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>They will bring a crowd of people and throw rocks at you to kill you. Then they will cut you into pieces with their swords.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>They will burn your house. They will punish you so that all the other women can see. I will stop you from living like a prostitute. I will stop you from paying money to your lovers.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Then I will stop being angry and jealous. I will calm down. I will not be angry anymore.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Why will all these things happen? Because you did not remember what happened when you were young. You did all those bad things and made me angry. So I had to punish you for doing them, but you planned even more terrible things.” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>“All the people who talk about you will now have one more thing to say. They will say, ‘Like mother, like daughter.’  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>You are your mother’s daughter. You don’t care about your husband or your children. You are like your sister. Both of you hated your husband and your children. <span class='add'>You are like your parents.</span> Your mother was a Hittite and your father was an Amorite.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Your older sister was Samaria.

Your younger sister was Sodom.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Samaria … Sodom Ezekiel is saying the people in Judah are just as evil as the people who lived in Samaria and Sodom—and those people were so evil that God completely destroyed those cities.</span></a> She lived to the south of you with her daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>You did all the terrible things they did, but you also did much worse!  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>I am the Lord GOD.

So I punished them! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>“And Samaria did only half as many bad things as you did. You did many more terrible things than Samaria! You have done so many more terrible things than your sisters have done. Sodom and Samaria seem good compared to you.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>So you must bear your shame. You have made your sisters look good compared to you. You have done terrible things, so you should be ashamed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>“I destroyed Sodom and the towns around it, and I destroyed Samaria and the towns around it.

Then you will remember the terrible things you did, and you will be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>So you and your sisters will be rebuilt.

The daughters of Edom<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Edom Or “Aram.”</span></a> and Philistia are making fun of you now.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Now you must suffer for the terrible things you did.” This is what the LORD said. </div><div class='s'>God Remains Faithful </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD said: “I will treat you like you treated me!

I made an agreement with you that will continue forever!  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>I will bring your sisters to you, and I will make them your daughters.
