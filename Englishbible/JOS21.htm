He commanded that you give us towns to live in and that you give us fields where our animals can eat.”  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So the Israelites obeyed this command from the LORD and gave the Levites these towns and the land around them for their animals: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The Kohath family groups were descendants of Aaron the priest from the tribe of Levi. Part of the Kohath family was given 13 towns in the areas that belonged to Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The other Kohath families were given ten towns in the areas that belonged to Ephraim, Dan, and half of Manasseh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The people from the Gershon family were given 13 towns. These towns were in the areas that belonged to Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half of Manasseh that was in Bashan. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The people from the Merari family were given 12 towns. These towns came from the areas that belonged to Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So the Israelites gave the Levites these towns and the fields around them, just as the LORD had told Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>These are the names of the towns that were in the areas that belonged to Judah and Simeon.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The first choice of towns was given to the Levites from the Kohath family group.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They gave them Kiriath Arba. (This is Hebron. It was named for a man named Arba. Arba was the father of Anak.) They also gave them some land near the town for their animals.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But the fields and the small towns around the city of Kiriath Arba belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So they gave the city of Hebron to Aaron’s descendants. (Hebron was a city of safety.) They also gave Aaron’s descendants the towns of Libnah,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jattir, Eshtemoa,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Holon, Debir,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Ain, Juttah, and Beth Shemesh.

These two tribes gave them nine towns. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They also gave Aaron’s descendants cities that belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. These cities were Gibeon, Geba,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Anathoth, and Almon. They gave them these four towns and some of the land near the towns for their animals.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In all, they gave 13 towns to the priests. (All priests were descendants of Aaron.) They also gave them some land near each town for their animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The other people from the Kohathite family groups were given towns that were in the areas that belonged to the tribe of Ephraim.

In all, Dan gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Half the tribe of Manasseh gave them Taanach and Gath Rimmon. In all, this half of Manasseh gave them two towns and some land around each town for their animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>In all, the rest of the people from the Kohath family groups got ten towns and some land around each town for their animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The Gershon family groups were also from the tribe of Levi. They got these towns: </div><div class='p'>Half the tribe of Manasseh gave them Golan in Bashan. (Golan was a city of safety.) Manasseh also gave them Be Eshtarah. In all, this half of Manasseh gave them two towns and some land around each town for their animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The tribe of Issachar gave them Kishion, Daberath,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jarmuth, and En Gannim. In all, Issachar gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The tribe of Asher gave them Mishal, Abdon,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Helkath, and Rehob. In all, Asher gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The tribe of Naphtali gave them Kedesh in Galilee.

All these towns were in areas that belonged to the other tribes.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Each of these towns had some land in it for their animals. That was true for every town. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>So the LORD kept the promise that he had made to the Israelites and gave the people all the land that he had promised. The people took the land and lived there.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And the LORD allowed them to have peace on all sides of their land, just as he had promised their ancestors. None of their enemies defeated them. The LORD allowed the Israelites to defeat every enemy.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The LORD kept every promise that he made to the Israelites. There were no promises that he failed to keep. Every promise came true. </div><ul class='tnav'>
