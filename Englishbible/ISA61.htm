The LORD has chosen me to tell good news to the poor and to comfort those who are sad. He sent me to tell the captives and prisoners that they have been set free.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He sent me to announce that the time has come for the LORD to show his kindness, when our God will also punish evil people. He has sent me to comfort those who are sad,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>those in Zion who mourn. I will take away the ashes on their head, and I will give them a crown. I will take away their sadness, and I will give them the oil of happiness. I will take away their sorrow, and I will give them celebration clothes. He sent me to name them ‘Good Trees’ and ‘The LORD’S Wonderful Plant.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the old cities that were destroyed will be rebuilt. Those ancient ruins will be made new, as they were in the beginning. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then your enemies will come to care for your sheep, and their children will work in your fields and in your gardens.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You will be called, ‘The LORD’S Priests,’ ‘The Servants of our God.’ You will be proud of all the riches that have come to you from all the nations on earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In the past, other people shamed you and said bad things to you. You were shamed much more than any other people. So in your land you will get two times more than other people. You will get the joy that continues forever.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That’s because I am the LORD and I love justice. I hate stealing and everything that is wrong. So I will give the people what they deserve. I will make an agreement with my people forever.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Their descendants will be known throughout the earth, and everyone will know their children. Whoever sees them will know that the LORD has blessed them. </div><div class='s'>God’s Servant Brings Salvation </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The LORD makes me very happy. </div><div class='q2'>I am completely happy with my God. </div><div class='q'>He dressed me in the clothes of salvation. </div><div class='q2'>He put the victory coat on me. </div><div class='q'>I look like a man dressed for his wedding, </div><div class='q2'>like a bride covered with jewels. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The earth causes plants to grow, </div><div class='q2'>and a garden makes the seeds planted there rise up. </div><div class='q'>In the same way, the Lord GOD will make goodness and praise </div><div class='q2'>grow throughout the nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
