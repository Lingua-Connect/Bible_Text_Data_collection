The snake spoke to the woman and said, “Woman, did God really tell you that you must not eat from any tree in the garden?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The woman answered the snake, “No, we can eat fruit from the trees in the garden.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But there is one tree we must not eat from. God told us, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. You must not even touch that tree, or you will die.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But the snake said to the woman, “You will not die.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>God knows that if you eat the fruit from that tree you will learn about good and evil, and then you will be like God!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The woman could see that the tree was beautiful and the fruit looked so good to eat. She also liked the idea that it would make her wise. So she took some of the fruit from the tree and ate it. Her husband was there with her, so she gave him some of the fruit, and he ate it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then it was as if their eyes opened, and they saw things differently. They saw that they were naked.

The man and the woman heard him, and they hid among the trees in the garden.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The LORD God called to the man and said, “Where are you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The man said, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid.
