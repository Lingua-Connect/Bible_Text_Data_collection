<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='s'>David Shames Saul </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After Saul had chased the Philistines away, people told him, “David is in the desert area near En Gedi.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So Saul chose 3000 men from all over Israel and began searching for David and his men. They looked near Wild Goat Rocks.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Saul came to some sheep pens beside the road. There was a cave near there, so Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were deep inside that same cave.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>David’s men told him, “This is day the LORD told you about when he said, ‘I will give your enemy to you, and you can do whatever you want to him.’ ” </div><div class='p'>So David crawled closer and closer to Saul and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe. Saul didn’t notice what happened.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Later, David felt bad about what he did.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He said to his men, “I pray the LORD never lets me do anything like that to my master again. I must not do anything against Saul, because he is the LORD’S chosen king.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> chosen king Literally, “anointed one.” Also in verse 10.</span></a>”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>David said these things to stop his men. He would not let his men hurt Saul. </div><div class='p'>Saul left the cave and went on his way.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Later, David came out of the cave and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” </div><div class='p'>Saul looked back. David bowed with his face to the ground to show his respect.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>David said to Saul, “Why do you listen when people say, ‘David plans to hurt you’?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You can see that with your own eyes that is not true. The LORD put you within my grasp today in the cave, but I refused to kill you. I was merciful to you. I said, ‘I won’t hurt my master. Saul is the LORD’S chosen king.’  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Look at this piece of cloth in my hand. I cut off the corner of your robe. I could have killed you, but I didn’t. Now, I want you to understand this. I want you to know that I am not planning anything against you. I did nothing wrong to you, but you are hunting me and trying to kill me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let the LORD be the judge. I hope the LORD will punish you for the wrong you did to me, but I won’t fight you myself.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>There is an old saying: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘Bad things come from bad people.’ </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'>“I haven’t done anything bad, and I won’t hurt you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Who are you chasing? Did the king of Israel bring an army to chase a single flea or a dying dog?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let the LORD be the judge. Let him decide between you and me. He will support me and show that I am right. He will save me from you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When David finished speaking, Saul asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” Then Saul lifted his voice and began to cry.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He said, “You are right, and I am wrong. You were good to me, even though I have been bad to you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You yourself said it when you told me about the good things you did. The LORD put my life in your hands, but you did not kill me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>This shows that you are not my enemy. A man doesn’t catch his enemy, and then just let him go. He doesn’t do good things for his enemy. May the LORD reward you for being good to me today.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now, I know that you will become the new king. You will rule the kingdom of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now make a promise to me with an oath using the LORD’S name. Promise that you will not kill my descendants, even after I die. Promise me that you will not erase my name from my father’s family.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So David made a promise to Saul. He promised that he would not kill Saul’s family. Then Saul went back home. David and his men went back up to the fort. </div><ul class='tnav'>
