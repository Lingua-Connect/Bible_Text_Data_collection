He will come and give you your reward. He will save you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the eyes of the blind will be opened so that they can see, and the ears of the deaf will be opened so that they can hear.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Crippled people will dance like deer, and those who cannot speak now will use their voices to sing happy songs.
