<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 27</div><div class='s'>Jacob Tricks Isaac </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Isaac grew old, and his eyes became so weak that he could not see clearly. One day he called his older son Esau to him and said, “Son!” </div><div class='p'>Esau answered, “Here I am.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Isaac said, “I am old. Maybe I will die soon.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So take your bow and arrows and go hunting. Kill an animal for me to eat.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Prepare the food that I love. Bring it to me, and I will eat it. Then I will bless you before I die.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So Esau went hunting. </div><div class='p'>Rebekah was listening when Isaac told this to his son Esau.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Listen, I heard your father talking to your brother Esau.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your father said, ‘Kill an animal for me to eat. Prepare the food for me, and I will eat it. Then, with the LORD as witness, I will bless you before I die.’  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So listen, son, and do what I tell you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Go out to our goats and bring me two young ones. I will prepare them the way your father loves them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then you will carry the food to your father, and he will bless you before he dies.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But Jacob told his mother Rebekah, “My brother Esau is a hairy man. I am not hairy like him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If my father touches me, he will know that I am not Esau. Then he will not bless me—he will curse me because I tried to trick him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So Rebekah said to him, “I will accept the blame if there is trouble. Do what I said. Go get the goats for me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Jacob went out and got two goats and brought them to his mother. His mother cooked the goats in the special way that Isaac loved.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Rebekah took the clothes that her older son Esau loved to wear. She put these clothes on the younger son Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>She took the skins of the goats and put them on Jacob’s hands and on his neck.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then she got the food she had cooked and gave it to Jacob. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jacob went to his father and said, “Father.” </div><div class='p'>His father answered, “Yes, son. Who are you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your first son. I have done what you told me. Now sit up and eat the meat from the animals that I hunted for you. Then you can bless me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But Isaac said to his son, “How have you hunted and killed the animals so quickly?” </div><div class='p'>Jacob answered, “Because the LORD your God allowed me to find the animals quickly.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near to me so that I can feel you, my son. If I can feel you, I will know if you are really my son Esau.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Jacob went to Isaac his father. Isaac felt him and said, “Your voice sounds like Jacob’s voice, but your arms are hairy like the arms of Esau.”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Isaac did not know it was Jacob, because his arms were hairy like Esau’s. So Isaac blessed Jacob. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Isaac said, “Are you really my son Esau?” </div><div class='p'>Jacob answered, “Yes, I am.” </div><div class='s'>The Blessing for Jacob </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Isaac said, “Bring me the food. I will eat it and bless you.” So Jacob gave him the food, and he ate it. Then Jacob gave him some wine, and he drank it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Isaac said to him. “Son, come near and kiss me.”  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So Jacob went to his father and kissed him. When Isaac smelled Esau’s clothes, he blessed him and said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“My son smells like the fields </div><div class='q2'>the LORD has blessed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>May God give you plenty of rain, </div><div class='q2'>good crops, and wine. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>May the nations serve you </div><div class='q2'>and many people bow down to you. </div><div class='q'>You will rule over your brothers. </div><div class='q2'>Your mother’s sons will bow down to you and obey you. </div><div class='q'>Whoever curses you will be cursed. </div><div class='q2'>Whoever blesses you will be blessed.” </div><div class='s'>Esau’s “Blessing” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Isaac finished blessing Jacob. Then, just as Jacob left his father Isaac, Esau came in from hunting.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Esau prepared the food in the special way his father loved. He brought it to his father and said, “Father, I am your son. Get up and eat the meat from the animals that I killed for you. Then you can bless me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” </div><div class='p'>He answered, “I am your son—your first son—Esau.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then Isaac became so upset that he began to shake. He said, “Then who was it that cooked and brought me food before you came? I ate it all, and I blessed him. Now it is too late to take back my blessing.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>When Esau heard his father’s words, he became very angry and bitter. He cried out and said to his father, “Then bless me also, father!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Isaac said, “Your brother tricked me! He came and took your blessing!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Esau said, “His name is Jacob.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Jacob This name is like the Hebrew word meaning “heel.” It also means “the one who follows” or “tricky.”</span></a> That is the right name for him. He has tricked me twice. He took away my rights as the firstborn son. And now he has taken away my blessing.” Then Esau said, “Have you saved any blessing for me?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Isaac answered, “I have already given Jacob the power to rule over you. And I said all his brothers would be his servants. I have given him the blessing for much grain and wine. There is nothing left to give you, my son.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But Esau continued to beg his father. “Do you have only one blessing, father? Bless me also, father!” Esau began to cry. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then Isaac said to him, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“You will not live on good land. </div><div class='q2'>You will not have much rain. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>You will have to fight to live, </div><div class='q2'>and you will be a slave to your brother. </div><div class='q'>But when you fight to be free, </div><div class='q2'>you will break away from his control.” </div><div class='s'>Jacob Leaves the Country </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>After that Esau hated Jacob because of this blessing. Esau said to himself, “My father will soon die, and after we are finished with that, I will kill Jacob.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Rebekah heard about Esau’s plan to kill Jacob. She sent for Jacob and said to him, “Listen, your brother Esau is planning to kill you.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>So, son, do what I say. My brother Laban is living in Haran. Go to him and hide.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Stay with him for a short time until your brother stops being angry.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>When your brother forgets what you did to him, I will send a servant to bring you back. I don’t want to lose both of my sons the same day.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “Your son Esau married Hittite women. I am very upset about this, because they are not our people. I’ll have nothing to live for if Jacob marries one of these women!” </div><ul class='tnav'>
