<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 39</div><div class='s'>The Priests’ Special Clothes </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The workers used the blue, purple, and red yarn to make special clothes for the priests to wear when they served in the holy place. They also made the special clothes for Aaron as the LORD had commanded Moses. </div><div class='s'>The Ephod </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They made the ephod from gold thread, fine linen, and blue, purple, and red yarn.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>(They hammered the gold into thin strips and cut the gold into long threads. They wove the gold into the blue, purple, and red yarn and fine linen. This was the work of a very skilled person.)  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They made the shoulder pieces for the ephod. They tied these shoulder pieces to the two corners of the ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They wove the cloth belt and fastened it to the ephod. It was made the same way as the ephod—they used gold thread, fine linen, and blue, purple, and red yarn, just as the LORD commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The workers put the onyx stones for the ephod in gold settings. They wrote the names of the sons of Israel on these stones.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then they put these jewels on the shoulder pieces of the ephod. These jewels were to help God to remember the Israelites. This was done as the LORD commanded Moses. </div><div class='s'>The Judgment Pouch </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then they made the judgment pouch. It was the work of a skilled person, just like the ephod. It was made from gold threads, fine linen, and blue, purple, and red yarn.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The judgment pouch was folded in half to make a square pocket. It was 1 span<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 1 span The distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger, about 9” (23 cm).</span></a> long and 1 span wide.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the workers put four rows of beautiful jewels on the judgment pouch. The first row had a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The second row had a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The third row had a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The fourth row had a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. All these jewels were set in gold.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>There were twelve jewels on the judgment pouch—one jewel for each of the sons of Israel. Each stone had the name of one of the sons of Israel carved onto it, like a seal. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The workers made two chains from pure gold for the judgment pouch. The chains were braided like a rope.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The workers made two gold rings and fastened them to two corners of the judgment pouch. Then they made two gold settings for the shoulder pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They fastened the gold chains to the rings at the corners of the judgment pouch.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They fastened the other ends of the gold chains to the settings on the shoulder pieces. They fastened these to the front of the ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then they made two more gold rings and put them on the other two corners of the judgment pouch. This was on the inside edge of the judgment pouch next to the ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They also put two gold rings on the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod. These rings were near the fastener, just above the cloth belt.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then they used a blue ribbon and tied the rings of the judgment pouch to the rings of the ephod. In this way the judgment pouch would rest close to the cloth belt and would be held tight against the ephod. They did everything just as the LORD commanded. </div><div class='s'>Other Clothes for the Priests </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then they made the robe for the ephod from blue cloth. It was woven by a skilled worker.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They made a hole in the center of the robe and sewed a piece of cloth around the edge of this hole. This cloth kept the hole from tearing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then they used fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn to make the cloth pomegranates. They hung these pomegranates around the bottom edge of the robe.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then they made bells from pure gold. They hung these bells around the bottom edge of the robe between the pomegranates.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Around the bottom edge of the robe there were bells and pomegranates. There was a bell following each pomegranate. This robe was for the priest to wear when he served the Lord. It was made just as the LORD commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Skilled workers wove shirts for Aaron and his sons. These shirts were made from fine linen.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the workers made a turban from fine linen. They also used fine linen to make cloth caps and underclothes.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then they made the cloth belt from fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn. Designs were sewn into the cloth. These things were made as the LORD had commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then they made a strip of pure gold for the holy crown. They carved these words into the gold like the writing on a seal: <span class='sc'>holy to the lord</span>.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Holy to the LORD These words were written on everything that was used in the Temple. This showed that these things belonged to the Lord, and that they could be used only for special purposes.

Then they tied the blue ribbon around the turban like the LORD had commanded Moses. </div><div class='s'>Moses Inspects the Holy Tent </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So all the work on the Holy Tent, that is, the Meeting Tent, was finished. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then they showed the Holy Tent and everything in it to Moses. They showed him the rings, the frames, the braces, the posts, and the bases.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They showed him the covering of the Tent that was made from ram skins dyed red and the covering that was made from fine leather. And they showed him the curtain that covered the entrance to the Most Holy Place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>They showed Moses the Box of the Agreement, the poles used for carrying it, and the mercy-cover.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>They showed him the table with everything on it and the special bread.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> special bread Also called “bread of the Presence.” Every day this bread was put before God on the special table in the Holy Place.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They showed him the pure gold lampstand and the lamps on it, the oil, and all the other things that were used with the lamps.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>They showed Moses the golden altar, the anointing oil, the sweet-smelling incense, and the curtain that covered the entrance to the Tent.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They showed him the bronze altar, the bronze screen, the poles used for carrying the altar, and everything that was used on the altar. They showed him the bowl and the base under the bowl. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>They showed Moses the wall of curtains around the courtyard with the posts and bases. They showed him the curtain that covered the entrance to the courtyard. They showed him the ropes and the tent pegs. They showed him everything in the Holy Tent, that is, the Meeting Tent. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then they showed Moses the clothes that were made for the priests serving in the holy area.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> holy area A restricted area that was considered sacred (special) because of God’s presence.</span></a> They showed him the special clothes for Aaron the priest and his sons to wear when they served as priests. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The Israelites did all this work exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Moses looked closely at all the work and saw that it was done exactly as the LORD had commanded.
