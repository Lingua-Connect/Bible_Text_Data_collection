The LORD has something to say against those who live in this land: “The people in this land are not honest or loyal. They don’t really know God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They are always cursing, lying, killing, stealing, and committing adultery. They murder one person after another.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So the country is like someone crying for the dead, and all of its people are weak. Even the animals of the field, the birds of the sky, and the fish in the sea are dying.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> dying Literally, “being taken away.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>No one should argue or blame another person. Priests, my argument is with you!<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or “The people cannot complain or blame someone else. The people are helpless, like arguing with a priest.” Many times the priests and Levites served as judges, and their decisions were final.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You priests will fall in the daytime. And at night the prophet will also fall with you. I will also destroy your mother. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“My people are destroyed because they have no knowledge. You priests have refused to learn, so I will refuse to let you be priests for me. You have forgotten the law of your God, so I will forget your children.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They became proud. They sinned more and more against me, so I will change their honor to shame. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“The priests fed on the people’s sins. They wanted more and more of their sin offerings.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> This is a wordplay. The word “sins” also means “sin offerings.” So instead of eating sacrifices, the priests became hungry for sin itself.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So the priests are no different from the people. I will punish them for the things they did. I will pay them back for the wrong things they did.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They will eat, but they will not be satisfied. They will commit sexual sins, but they will not have babies.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> They … babies A part of worshiping the false gods was having sexual relations with temple prostitutes. The people thought this would make the gods happy. And then the gods would give the people large families and good crops.</span></a> This is because they left the LORD and became like prostitutes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“Sexual sins, strong drink, and new wine ruin a person’s ability to think straight.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>My people are asking pieces of wood for advice. They think those sticks will answer them! They have chased after those false gods like prostitutes and have left their own God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They make sacrifices on the tops of the mountains and burn incense on the hills under oak trees, poplar trees, and elm trees.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> under … trees Trees and groves were an important part of worshiping false gods.</span></a> The shade under those trees looks nice. So your daughters lie under those trees like prostitutes, and your daughters-in-law commit sexual sins. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“I cannot blame your daughters or your daughters-in-law for doing this, because your men go and have sex with the temple prostitutes<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> temple prostitutes Women who were prostitutes at the temples of the false gods. Their sexual sins were part of worshiping those false gods.</span></a> and offer sacrifices with them. This is how foolish people destroy themselves. </div><div class='s'>The Shameful Sins of Israel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“Israel, just because you act like a prostitute doesn’t mean that Judah should feel guilty too.

He is like a shepherd who takes his sheep to a large field with plenty of grass. But Israel is stubborn like a young cow that runs away again and again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Ephraim has joined his idols, so leave him alone.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Ephraim has joined their drunkenness.
