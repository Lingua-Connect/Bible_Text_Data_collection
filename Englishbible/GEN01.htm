At first,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>the earth was completely empty. There was nothing on the earth. Darkness covered the ocean, and God’s Spirit moved over<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> moved over The Hebrew word means “to fly over” or “to swoop down,” like a bird flying over its nest to protect its babies.</span></a> the water. </div><div class='s2'>The First Day—Light </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let there be light!” And light began to shine.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. While 2 the earth had no special shape, and darkness covered the ocean, and God’s Spirit hovered over the water, 3 God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.” Or “When God began to create the sky and the earth, 2 while the earth was completely empty, and darkness covered the ocean, and a powerful wind blew over the water, 3 God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He saw the light, and he knew that it was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>God named the light “day,” and he named the darkness “night.” </div><div class='p'>There was evening, and then there was morning. This was the first day. </div><div class='s2'>The Second Day—Sky </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let there be a space<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> space Or “firmament.” The Hebrew word can refer to a piece of metal that has been hammered into the shape of a bowl.</span></a> to separate the water into two parts!”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So God made the space and separated the water. Some of the water was above it, and some of the water was below it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>God named that space “sky.” There was evening, and then there was morning. This was the second day. </div><div class='s2'>The Third Day—<br/>Dry Land and Plants </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered together so that the dry land will appear.” And it happened.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>God named the dry land “earth,” and he named the water that was gathered together “seas.” And God saw that this was good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let the earth grow grass, plants that make grain, and fruit trees. The fruit trees will make fruit with seeds in it. And each plant will make its own kind of seed. Let these plants grow on the earth.” And it happened.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The earth grew grass and plants that made grain. And it grew trees that made fruit with seeds in it. Every plant made its own kind of seeds. And God saw that this was good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>There was evening, and then there was morning. This was the third day. </div><div class='s2'>The Fourth Day—Sun, Moon, and Stars </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let there be lights in the sky. These lights will separate the days from the nights. They will be used for signs to show when special meetings<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> special meetings The Israelites used the sun and moon to decide when the months and years began.

He made the larger light to rule during the day and the smaller light to rule during the night. He also made the stars.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>God put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He put them in the sky to rule over the day and over the night. They separated the light from the darkness. And God saw that this was good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>There was evening, and then there was morning. This was the fourth day. </div><div class='s2'>The Fifth Day—Fish and Birds </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let the water be filled with many living things, and let there be birds to fly in the air over the earth.”  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So God created the large sea animals.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> large sea animals Or “sea monsters.”</span></a> He created all the many living things in the sea and every kind of bird that flies in the air. And God saw that this was good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>God blessed all the living things in the sea and told them to have many babies and fill the seas. And he blessed the birds on land and told them to have many more babies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There was evening, and then there was morning. This was the fifth day. </div><div class='s2'>The Sixth Day—<br/>Land Animals and People </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let the earth produce many kinds of living things. Let there be many different kinds of animals. Let there be large animals and small crawling animals of every kind. And let all these animals produce more animals.” And all these things happened. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So God made every kind of animal. He made the wild animals, the tame animals, and all the small crawling things. And God saw that this was good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then God said, “Now let’s make humans<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> humans The Hebrew word means “man,” “people,” or the name “Adam.” It is like the word meaning “earth” or “red clay.”</span></a> who will be like us.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Now let’s make … like us Or “Now let’s make humans in our image and in our likeness.”</span></a> They will rule over all the fish in the sea and the birds in the air. They will rule over all the large animals and all the little things that crawl on the earth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So God created humans in his own image. He created them to be like himself.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> So God created humans … himself Or “So God created them in his image. In the image of God he created them.” Compare Genesis 5:1, 3.</span></a> He created them male and female.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>God blessed them and said to them, “Have many children. Fill the earth and take control of it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the air. Rule over every living thing that moves on the earth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>God said, “I am giving you all the grain bearing plants and all the fruit trees. These trees make fruit with seeds in it. This grain and fruit will be your food.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And I am giving all the green plants to the animals. These green plants will be their food. Every animal on earth, every bird in the air, and all the little things that crawl on the earth will eat that food.” And all these things happened. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>God looked at everything he had made.
