Learn these laws and be sure to obey them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The LORD our God made an agreement with us at Mount Horeb.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The LORD did not make this agreement with our ancestors, but with us—yes, with all of us who are alive here today.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The LORD spoke with you face to face at that mountain. He spoke to you from the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But you were afraid of the fire. And you did not go up the mountain. So I stood between you and the LORD to tell you what the LORD said. He said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>‘I am the LORD your God. I am the one who freed you from Egypt, where you were slaves. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>‘You must not worship any other gods except me. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>‘You must not make any idols. Don’t make any statues or pictures of anything up in the sky or of anything on the earth or of anything down in the water.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Don’t worship or serve idols of any kind, because I am the LORD your God. I hate for my people to worship other gods.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> I hate … gods Or “I am El Kanah—the Jealous God.”</span></a> People who sin against me become my enemies. And I will punish them, and their children, their grandchildren, and even their great-grandchildren.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But I will be very kind to people who love me and obey my commands. I will be kind to their families for thousands of generations!<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or “But I will show mercy to thousands of people who love me and obey my commands.”</span></a> </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>‘You must not use the name of the LORD your God to make empty promises. If you do, the LORD will not let you go unpunished. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>‘You must keep the Sabbath a special day like the LORD your God commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Work six days a week and do your job,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>but the seventh day is a day of rest in honor of the LORD your God. So on that day no one should work—not you, your sons and daughters, foreigners living in your cities or your men and women slaves. Not even your cattle, donkeys, and other animals should do any work! Your slaves should be able to rest just as you do.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Don’t forget that you were slaves in the land of Egypt. The LORD your God brought you out of Egypt with his great power and made you free. That is why the LORD your God commands you to always make the Sabbath a special day. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>‘You must honor your father and your mother. The LORD your God has commanded you to do this. If you follow this command, you will live a long time, and everything will go well for you in the land that the LORD your God gives you. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>‘You must not murder anyone. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>‘You must not commit the sin of adultery. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>‘You must not steal. </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>‘You must not tell lies about other people.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or “You must not be a false witness against your neighbor.”</span></a> </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>‘You must not want another man’s wife.

You must not want to take anything that belongs to another person.’ ” </div><div class='s'>The People Were Afraid of God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moses said, “The LORD gave these commands to all of you when you were together there at the mountain. He spoke in a loud voice that came from the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness. After he gave us these commands, he didn’t say any more. He wrote his words on two stone tablets and gave them to me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“You heard the voice from the darkness while the mountain was burning with fire. Then all the elders and the other leaders of your tribes came to me.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They said, ‘The LORD our God has shown us his Glory and his greatness! We heard him speak from the fire. We have seen today that it is possible to continue living even after God speaks to us.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But if we hear the LORD our God speak to us again, surely we will die! That terrible fire will destroy us. We don’t want to die.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>No one has ever heard the living God speak from the fire like we have and still lived!  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Moses, you go near and hear everything the LORD our God says. Then tell us everything the LORD tells you. We will listen to you, and we will do everything you say.’ </div><div class='s'>The Lord Speaks to Moses </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“The LORD heard what you said and told me, ‘I heard what the people said. And that is fine.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>I only wanted to change their way of thinking—I wanted them to respect me and obey all my commands from the heart. Then everything would be fine with them and with their descendants forever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>“ ‘Go and tell the people to go back to their tents,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>but you stand here near me. I will tell you all the commands, laws, and rules that you must teach them. They must do these things in the land that I am giving them to live in.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>“So you people must be careful to do everything the LORD commanded you. Do not stop following God!  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>You must live the way the LORD your God commanded you. Then you will continue to live, and everything will be fine with you.
