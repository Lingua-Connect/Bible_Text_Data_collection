Here are the names of those sons:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Another son, Joseph, was already in Egypt. So Jacob’s whole family was with him in Egypt—70 descendants in all. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Later, Joseph, his brothers, and all the people of that generation died.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But the Israelites had many children, and their number grew until the country of Egypt was filled with them. </div><div class='s'>Trouble for the Israelites </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then a new king began to rule Egypt. He did not know Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This king said to his people, “Look at the Israelites. There are too many of them, and they are stronger than we are!  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>We must make plans to stop them from growing stronger. If there is a war, they might join our enemies, defeat us, and escape from the land!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Egyptians decided to make life hard for the Israelites, so they put slave masters over the people. These masters forced the Israelites to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses for the king. The king used these cities to store grain and other things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The Egyptians forced the Israelites to work harder and harder. But the harder they worked, the more they grew and spread, and the more the Egyptians became afraid of them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the Egyptians made them work even harder. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They made life hard for the Israelites.

They were named Shiphrah and Puah. The king of Egypt said to the nurses,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“You will continue to help the Hebrew women give birth to their children.
