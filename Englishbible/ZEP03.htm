<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='s'>The Future of Jerusalem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jerusalem, your people fought against God. They hurt other people, and you have been stained with sin.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They didn’t listen to me or accept my teachings. Jerusalem didn’t trust the LORD. Jerusalem didn’t go to her God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jerusalem’s leaders are like roaring lions. Her judges are like hungry wolves that come in the evening to attack the sheep—and in the morning nothing is left.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Her prophets are always making secret plans to get more and more. Her priests have treated holy things as if they were not holy. They have done bad things to God’s teachings.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But the LORD is still in that city, and he continues to be good. He does not do anything wrong. He continues to help his people. Morning after morning he makes good decisions for them. Not a day passes without his justice. He never gives a decision that is crooked or is something to be ashamed of. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The Lord says, “I have destroyed whole nations and their defense towers. I destroyed their streets and now no one goes there anymore. Their cities are empty—no one lives there anymore.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I tell you this so that you will learn a lesson. I want you to fear and respect me. If you do this, your home will not be destroyed, and I will not have to punish you the way I planned.” But those evil people only wanted to do more of the same evil things they had already done! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The LORD said, “So just wait! Wait for me to stand and judge you. I have the right to bring people from many nations and use them to punish you. I will use them to show my anger against you. I will use them to show how upset I am—and the whole country will be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then I will change people from other nations so that they can speak the language clearly and call out the name of the LORD. They will all worship me together, shoulder to shoulder, as one people.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>People will come all the way from the other side of the river in Ethiopia. My scattered people will come to me. My worshipers will come and bring their gifts to me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“Then, Jerusalem, you will no longer be ashamed of the wrong things your people do against me. That is because I will remove all the bad people from Jerusalem. I will take away all the proud people. There will not be any of them on my holy mountain.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> holy mountain Mount Zion, one of the mountains Jerusalem was built on.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will let only meek and humble people stay in my city, and they will trust the LORD’S name.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The survivors of Israel will not do bad things or tell lies. They will not try to trick people with lies. They will be like sheep that eat and lie down in peace—and no one will bother them.” </div><div class='s'>A Happy Song </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jerusalem, sing and be happy! </div><div class='q2'>Israel, shout for joy! </div><div class='q2'>Jerusalem, be happy and have fun! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The LORD stopped your punishment. </div><div class='q2'>He destroyed your enemies’ strong towers. </div><div class='q'>King of Israel, the LORD is with you. </div><div class='q2'>You don’t need to worry about anything bad happening. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At that time Jerusalem will be told, </div><div class='q2'>“Be strong, don’t be afraid! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The LORD your God is with you. </div><div class='q2'>He is like a powerful soldier. </div><div class='q2'>He will save you. </div><div class='q'>He will show how much he loves you </div><div class='q2'>and how happy he is with you. </div><div class='q'>He will laugh and be happy about you, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>like people at a party. </div><div class='q'>I will take away your shame. </div><div class='q2'>I will make them stop hurting you.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Hebrew text here is hard to understand.</span></a> </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>At that time I will punish those who hurt you. </div><div class='q2'>I will save my hurt people </div><div class='q2'>and bring back those who were forced to leave. </div><div class='q'>I will give them praise and honor everywhere, </div><div class='q2'>even in places where they suffered shame. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>At that time I will lead you back home. </div><div class='q2'>I will bring your people back together. </div><div class='q'>I will cause people everywhere to honor and praise you. </div><div class='q2'>You will see me bring back all the blessings you once had.” </div><div class='q'>This is what the LORD said. </div><ul class='tnav'>
