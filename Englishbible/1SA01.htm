</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='s'>Elkanah’s Family Worships at Shiloh </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>There was a man named Elkanah from the Zuph family who lived in Ramah in the hill country of Ephraim. Elkanah was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph from the tribe of Ephraim. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Elkanah had two wives. One wife was named Hannah and the other wife was named Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Every year Elkanah left his town of Ramah and went up to Shiloh. He worshiped the LORD All-Powerful at Shiloh and offered sacrifices to the Lord there. Shiloh was where Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas, served as priests of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Whenever Elkanah offered his sacrifices, he always gave one share of the food to his wife Peninnah and a share of the food to each of Peninnah’s children.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Elkanah always gave an equal share<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> equal share Or “double share.”</span></a> of the food to Hannah. He did this because he loved her very much, even though the LORD had not let Hannah have any children. </div><div class='s'>Peninnah Upsets Hannah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Peninnah always upset Hannah and made her feel bad because the LORD had not made her able to have children.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>This happened every year when their family went to the LORD’S house at Shiloh. Peninnah would upset Hannah so much that she would begin to cry and would not eat anything. One year when this happened,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why won’t you eat? Why are you so sad? You have me. Isn’t that better than having even ten sons?” </div><div class='s'>Hannah’s Prayer </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>After eating and drinking, Hannah quietly got up and went to pray to the Lord.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> went to pray to the Lord This is from the ancient Greek version.</span></a> Eli the priest was sitting on a chair near the door of the LORD’S Holy Building.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Holy Building This could mean the Holy Tent at Shiloh where people went to worship the Lord or a larger area where they put the Holy Tent.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hannah was so sad that she cried the whole time she was praying to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>She made a special promise to God and said, “LORD All-Powerful, you can see how sad I am. Remember me. Don’t forget me. If you will give me a son, I will give him to you. He will be yours his whole life, and as a Nazirite, he will not drink wine or strong drink,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> he … strong drink This is found in the ancient Greek version and a Hebrew scroll from Qumran but not in the standard Hebrew text.</span></a> and no one will ever cut his hair.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hannah prayed to the LORD a long time. Eli was watching her mouth while she was praying.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Hannah was praying in her heart. Her lips were moving, but since she did not say the words out loud, Eli thought she was drunk.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He said to her, “You have had too much to drink. It is time to put away the wine.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Hannah answered, “Sir, I have not drunk any wine or beer. I am deeply troubled, and I was telling the LORD about all my problems.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Don’t think I am a bad woman. I have been praying so long because I have so many troubles and am very sad.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Eli answered, “Go in peace. May the God of Israel give you what you asked for.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Hannah said, “May you be happy with me.” Then she left and ate something. She was not sad anymore. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Early the next morning Elkanah’s family got up. They worshiped the LORD and then went back home to Ramah. </div><div class='s'>Samuel’s Birth </div><div class='p'>Elkanah had sexual relations with his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered Hannah.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>By that time the following year, Hannah had become pregnant and had a son. She named him Samuel.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Samuel This name means “His name is El (God).” But in Hebrew it is like “heard by God.”</span></a> She said, “His name is Samuel because I asked the LORD for him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Elkanah went to Shiloh to offer the sacrifice for that year and the gift he had promised to the LORD. He took his family with him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But Hannah did not go. She told Elkanah, “When the boy is old enough to eat solid food, I will take him to Shiloh. Then I will give him to the LORD. He will become a Nazirite.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> He will become a Nazirite This is found in the ancient Greek version and a Hebrew scroll from Qumran but not in the standard Hebrew text.</span></a> He will stay there at Shiloh.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Hannah’s husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what you think is best. You may stay home until the boy is old enough to eat solid food. May the LORD do what you<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> you This is from the ancient Greek version and a Hebrew scroll from Qumran. The standard Hebrew text has “he.”</span></a> have said.” So Hannah stayed at home to nurse her son until he was old enough to eat solid food. </div><div class='s'>Hannah Takes Samuel to Eli at Shiloh </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When the boy was old enough to eat solid food, Hannah took him to the LORD’S house at Shiloh. She also took a bull that was three years old, 20 pounds<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 20 pounds Literally, “an ephah” (22 l).</span></a> of flour, and a bottle of wine. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They went before the Lord. Elkanah killed the bull as a sacrifice to the Lord as he usually did.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> They went … he usually did This is found in the ancient Greek version and a Hebrew scroll from Qumran but not in the standard Hebrew text.</span></a> Then Hannah gave the boy to Eli.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>She said to him, “Pardon me, sir. I am the same woman who stood near you praying to the LORD. I promise that I am telling the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I prayed for this child, and the LORD answered my prayer. He gave me this child.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And now I give this child to the LORD. He will serve<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> serve Or “belong to.”</span></a> the LORD all his life.” </div><div class='p'>Then Hannah left the boy there<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> left the boy there This is found in a Hebrew scroll from Qumran but not in the standard Hebrew text.</span></a> and worshiped the LORD. </div><ul class='tnav'>
